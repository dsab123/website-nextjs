So a wonderful couple at our church is moving away for a while. Having seen their godly example in our church, my fiancé and I, on the cusp of marriage, asked if they were available for a double date. We made our reasons plain — we were hoping to ask them a whole bunch of questions about married life.

We found this discussion very helpful, so I’m putting up an edited version of our topics of discussion. Peppered throughout are book recommendations.

## Family Relationships
-   Of all the siblings, they ask for the least help from their parents. This gives much room for growth, and enables you to be fully independent.
-   Family relations are often sources of conflict; it is good to have a respectable distance.
-   Part of growing into marriage is learning to be distant from family, and learning to be gracious to them as if you're gracious to strangers.
-   The best way to interact with adult siblings is to treat them as friends.
    -   When they ask for advice, don't always give it; you can be a positive influence without saying everything on your mind.
        -   "A prophet is respected everywhere except in his hometown."
        -   “A friend close at hand is better than brother far away."
-   Family will always be there, but you'll probably have better relationships with non-family over the long run.

### Friendships
-   Women tend to be more toxic than men, so the wife needs to be careful with who she lets into her life.
-   Pursue friendships with the same gender in couples, man with man, woman with woman.
-   The man shouldn’t pursue friendships with another man if their wives couldn’t develop a close friendship, and vice-versa.
    -   They've had to turn away from friendships that seem easy or fun for one, for the sake of the other.

### The Honeymoon Phase
-   _Background_: Many couples, as well as some marriage books, have told us that one day in your first year you will wake up and suddenly come to a (false) realization that you married the wrong person, at which the primal flight instinct takes over. This, apparently, is when you realize that the honeymoon phase in your relationship is over. However, try as we might, we’d been unable to see ourselves coming to the end of our honeymoon phase. So we asked them whether the honeymoon phase _really_ does end. Are we just inexperienced lovebirds, or is there hope for us to remain lovebirds forever?    
-   Their answer: The honeymoon phase certainly doesn’t have to end!
-   Husband, your wife is what you treat her!
-   The first year of marriage does not have to be hard, but will require adjustment and handling awkwardness.
    -   Pay attention to budgeting and moving in particular.
    -   Learn to say to yourself, "You're not being very responsible, self.” Don’t blame the spouse for things that aren't their fault.    
    -   Don't use the other person to abdicate your own responsibility for yourself; ask "how would I handle this if I was single?"
-   Developing a couple mindset and awareness can take some time, especially with regard to socializing.
<br></br>

### Physical Exercise
-   You must have a dedicated routine; when kids come around, they’ll make it harder to be regular   
-   Give each other turns when you can; one spouse takes the kid(s) while the other works out.
-   Develop a long-term view about exercise - plan to be healthy and fit at age X.
-   Try to build habits over 5 year periods:
    -   Jog at least 3 times a week
    -   Add core workouts
    -   Strength training is good too
-   Wife should be careful after the first child; husband, don't let the wife "let herself go." You can care for her in this way.
<br></br>

### Finances
-   General Thoughts    
    -   We never buy a bigger house than we can afford.
    -   We buy houses our friends may not buy (not the richest neighborhoods, not as fancy, etc).
    -   Book Recommendation: _Financial Peace_, Dave Ramsey
-   Prepare for possibility of unexpected job loss
    -   Have a nest egg of 3-6 months of living expenses saved up.
    -   With regard to work, know that “excellence is always in demand" - excellence is huge job security, and will always be attractive to employers.
-   Always budget and live on one salary
    -   Many people find themselves trapped into two incomes. For example, they buy too expensive of a house, then need two salaries to pay off the mortgage.
    -   Its too hard to feed yourself and maintain a house if two people are working.
<br></br>

### Children
-   Spanking
    -   Use a wooden spoon.
    -   If they're not crying, it's not a spanking.
    -   Spank for specific things, and tie back each spanking to those things - defiant disobedience, respect, deceit.
    -   Know that kids are good at games and are very clever.
    -   It might take a while to name specific behaviors that you punish them for, but is an important practice, as it delineates clear expectations.
        -   Instruct kids to *obey right away, with happy heart, and a respectful mouth*    
    -   Book Recommendation: _Give them Grace_, Elyse Fitzpatrick
-   Wife, watch for toxic fear that changes your behavior, especially post-partum.
    -   Man, learn that God gave you to her to make her more reasonable. Her fears will be irrational at times.
    -   God gives you to each other to balance you out; if both struggle in a particular way or bent, God gave you the church.
    -   You're supposed to become more like each other over the years.
        -   Tim Keller calls this “Gender Completeness” in his book Meaning of Marriage.
-   Discipline should carry more than just negative connotation - it is also has a positive to it.
    -   With kids, say "if you don't do this, I'm going to discipline you _more_", because the instruction _itself_ is discipline.

### Church Membership and Service
-   Sign up for a little at a time, for a set time. Don’t burn out!
    -   ***It is by building up little by little that they were able to handle serving the church in a major way.***
    -   *Don't pick up 8 service opportunities indefinitely, so that you don't do them all poorly or end up being flakes.*
-   Automate some of the work - email communications, for example.
    -   Don't fall into making people numbers to check off, but you need some systemization.
-   Know that churches can be very hard to serve in.
-   Serving the church takes a lot of time away from the family.
-   Husband, if you can't guard your time with your wife and give her what she needs, then you don't have anything to give the church.
-   Know that a lot of church problems stem from one person having a theological axe to grind.

### General Advice
-   Think of yourselves as a power couple:
    -   Wife, think of ways to support your husband in his career.
    -   Husband, support and encourage your wife in her pursuits.
    -   Be ready for everything - impromptu hosting, emergency trips, etc.
        -   Have dishes always done, laundry on the dryer, be dressed.
        -   When you have your own chores done, you can be really flexible toward others.
-   Fighting
    -   The worst part of a fight is feeling alone, and worried that your spouse doesn't love you anymore.
        -   Know that even in your deepest disagreements, when you feel most alone, Christ will never leave you nor forsake you.
    -   Good couples who are able to communicate with each other well will feel this very rarely, thankfully.
-   Read a book for everything you try to do; a lot of people don’t do this!
    -   Learn to ask yourself and others, “Where did you read that?"
    -   Write about everything you might say to others before you actually say it.
        -   This develops conviction behind your words that you need to be persuasive.
-   Do things together to develop your friendship
    -   Try to have shared hobbies, do them together, shy away from your "own” things.    
        -   In premarital counseling, our counselor warned us of ever using the phrase “let's agree to disagree” for the same reason. “Own” things are areas in your life over which you are sovereign, and are consequently areas that your spouse cannot speak into.    
    -   Go to bed together, wake up together
        -   Almost nobody does this! Make it a point to do this.
    -   Try to read the same books; watch the same movies.
-   Learn to be disciplined in everything
    -   We eat our meals at the same time because its time, not because we're hungry, for example.
    -   Don’t become a couple who can’t keep your commitments.
-   Productivity - Book Recommendation: _Do More Better_, Tim Challies
-   Be in the moment - go to the costume party _with_ a costume.
-   Don’t shy away from doing things for others - the more you do in service to others, the bigger your “service muscles" become.
-   Ask each other, “Hey you, tell me something I don't know about you!"
