Little Miriam,

You are in your mother's arms as she sits in the recliner beside me. We are in our vacation home at the Outer Banks. Your big sister's asleep.

You have a fever right now, and we are praying that our Father heals you. Mommy is particularly worried about how your fever goes up when you don't sleep. I try to comfort her with God's promises to take care of our children, we being His children.

Though I can't see your face, I can feel your gaze radiate from your mother's as you stare lovingly at her. You are cooing through your fever.

You have been awake now for upwards of four hours, far too long for a little febrile one to be awake. You and your mother are having a very simple conversation: "Oh, when will you go to sleep, little one?" "Coooh, eeeeaaa." The exchange repeats, as you wave your arms with a determined wave.

Ah, now you are saying "ba, baaa, baa ba." 

You turn, your eyes are visible to me now, as you leave your mother's gaze to focus your sights on the ceiling fan.

A few minutes later - "She's not acting droopy anymore', your mother says. "Do you want to crawl on the ground? You look like there's some stuff you gotta do."

Another coo in response.

What a blessing to be in this family, my God. What a terrible responsibility to lead them.

Ah, you are looking at me now while mommy cuddles you. We lock eyes, even as I write, and then I decide to put down the laptop to hold you in my arms.
