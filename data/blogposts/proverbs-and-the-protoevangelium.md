In Proverbs 7:1 and 7:24 and a few other places in Proverbs, 5:1 and 5:7 at least, Solomon's audience grows from one son to multiple sons:

**Main idea: the growth of the number of the sons of Solomon listening to his address, as well as the 'transcendent' victories of the adulteress are the tip of the iceberg of the revelation of the Protoevangelium in Proverbs!**

The adulterous woman, throughout the entirety of the chapter, is treated as a single entity, _until_ 7:26-7:27, when her conquests are descried as a mighty throng and as spiritual (her house is the way to Sheol). Clearly Solomon is broadening his scope to include more than just one adulterous woman.

Perhaps there is an echo of the battle between the seed of the woman in Solomon and his sons, and the seed of the serpent, exemplified in the growth of Solomon's audience and the revealing of the spiritual forces behind the adulterous woman?

What are the implications of this redemptive thread here?
- We are sons of our wise Father, who has banded us together to fight in walking together on the right path!
- The battle between the adulterous woman and I (or rather the _avoidance_ of the battle) is not just between her and I, but includes many people, which must span the whole of redemptive history:
	- On the one side are the sons of the King, instructed together by their father.
		- May we band together as brothers in keeping each other from such a heinous sin, which must not even be named among us.
	- On the other side, the adulterous woman and her slain
		- She is one tool in the arsenal of the Serpent, a potent one at that. The Harlot finds her place as a major character in Revelation 17 and 19.
- This of course takes us back to Genesis 3:15, the Protoevangelium. If we find Solomon training his sons to be wise and fight against the Serpent and his adulterous woman, we can trace the conflict's origin to Genesis 3:15. We see a few things there:
	- God initiates this conflict
	- the seed of the woman will one day crush the head of the serpent
