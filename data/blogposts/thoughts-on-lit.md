“The motto of the reading Christian is a dazzling doxology: ‘In Your light we see light.’ (Psalm 36:9)" 
<br>
### Chapter 1: Paper Pulp and Etched Granite: Laying the cornerstone of our theology of books

The goal of this chapter is to give us a properly high view of Scripture, which Reinke calls the ‘Etched Granite’, over and above the uninspired works of men, dubbed ‘Paper Pulp.'
<br>

“The day God ran His fingertip over the stone tablets was the day that He forever shaped the world of book publishing."
<br>

There are 6 things about the Scriptures that set them apart from all other books:

1.  The Bible is inspired
2.  The Bible is inerrant
3.  The Bible is sufficient
4.  The Bible is living and active
5.  The Bible is supreme
6.  The Bible offers us a coherent worldview
<br>

“God’s words are always true, because God’s words are self-validating. God speaks, and His words shape and resolve what is true and good (Genesis 1, John 17:17)."
<br>

All our reading needs to be examined by the lens of Scripture; “Scripture is the ultimate grid by which we read every other book."
<br>

Our reading should be divided into 2 categories:

1.  The Bible
2.  All other books

Reinke quotes Spurgeon to close out the chapter:
<br>

“All other books might be heaped together in one pile and burned with less loss to the world than would be occasioned by the obliteration of a single page of the sacred volume … Let others speak as they may. We could sooner part with all that is sublime and beautiful, or cheering and profitable, in human literature than lose a single syllable from the Mouth of God."

### Chapter 2: Wide-Eyed Into The Son: How personal sin and the gospel shape our literacy

This chapter's goal is to stress the importance of conversion for spiritual benefit when reading both the Scriptures and other books.
<br>

Regeneration is needed to gain this benefit: “This act of illumination is so powerful and so obviously the handiwork of God that the fitting metaphor is God’s ignition of the sun in our solar system: “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6).
<br>

When we undergo this “unveiling transformation”, we “feel the warm brightness of Christ’s glory."
<br>

After regeneration, we can now see “Jesus, the Prophet, Priest, and King—speaking, dying, and reigning."
<br>

We read for communion with God, not merely knowledge!
<br>

Reinke will argue that we can read “all our books illuminated by God and in communion with Him.” I think what he means here is that we can glean spiritual things from all that we read.
<br>

“Literacy is a Spiritual Discipline."
<br>

### Chapter 3: Reading is Believing: Savoring Books in an Eye-Candy Culture

This chapter’s goal is to explain why words are better suited to communicate deep truths than images. A fascinating study of words-vs-images in Israel’s struggles against God is included here too! Reinke applies this word-image tension to the reader: “This chapter is about images and books, but more fundamentally about the trajectory of your life.” This sentence escalated quickly.
<br>

David Wells, a cool philosopher-theologian or something: “The cultural mantle has passed from the users of words to the makers of images."
<br>

"The immediate appeal of visual entertainment is at odds with the gradual unveiling of literary treasure. Entertainment is passive and easy; books require an active mind and diligence."
<br>

“The Bible often speaks in shorthand of pagan nations as those who ‘worship wood and stone’ (Ezekiel 20:31; Daniel 5:4, 23; Revelation 9:20). By contrast, God planned to lead His people through this world of visual idols by words from His own lips—in language, through His revealed Word.” In the disaster at Mount Sinai, when the Israelites’ jewelry was smelted into the calf, “The adornment of the ear was sacrificed in order to create an image pleasing to the eye. The ear (the receiver of God’s word) was plundered for the eye (the receiver of the image). The irony is striking.” Whoa.
<br>

This capitulation of word to image repeats throughout Israel’s history! “They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made for themselves metal images” (2 Kings 17:16).
<br>

For Christians today, "this word/image tension is a battle for our hearts.” "Language is the basis of our relationship with God, and a deeply personal means to experience Him.” “The concern is whether Christians will be patient enough to find meaning embedded in words, or if we will grow content with the superficial pleasures offered to us in the rapidly shifting images in our culture."
<br>

Reinke gives four reasons why words are better suited for communication than images:

1.  Language best captures the meaning of visible realities
    - Pictures can only communicate an instant of time, without any context. We can only see the meaning of the picture insofar as what we actually see on the page. “'It takes words and thought give the real truth and meaning behind what is seen.’ Os Guiness"
<br>

2. Language best communicates invisible realities.
    -   “Words take you by the hand down to the depths of the human soul and up to the heights of an unseen eternity.” ❤️
    -   This can be illustrated in the history of the Roman Catholic church, which attempted to teach the illiterate masses through the use and worship of images, relics, and icons. The people needed words, namely the preached word, in order to benefit spiritually. The Reformation was “a recovery of the biblical centrality of words."
<br>

3.  Language best informs our Eternal Hope
    -   “Because language enables us to believe in the unseen (previous point), language makes faith possible."
4.  Language makes worldview possible
    -   “Our lives cannot find context through images.” And this context is what our worldview should be. Images are snapshots. You can’t build a very good movie from snapshots (theoretically, this isn’t so true; but this analogy is mine, not Reinke’s).
<br>

“As a word-centered people we must learn to prize language in a visually dominated world. If out hearts prioritize images over language, our hunger for books will erode.” This is the trajectory-of-your-life stuff he mentioned earlier.
<br>

Coming full circle, “the point of this chapter is simple: the difficult work required to benefit from books is at odds with the immediate appeal of images."  
<br>

### Chapter 4: Reading From Across the Canyon: How a Biblical Worldview Equips us to benefit from books

This chapter’s goal is to give us a basic Biblical Worldview that we can use to examine books that we read.
<br>

“The general plot of the Biblical story hangs on the progress of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. Within this plot we learn propositional truths that inform us about the activity of God, the condition of the world, the dignity of humanity, the sin in our hearts, the work of our Savior, the return of our Savior, and the restoration of nature. The Bible answers the important questions..."
<br>

Apparently, Shakespeare’s writings were influenced heavily by The Book Of Common Prayer and the Geneva Bible. That's rad.
<br>

A Biblical worldview helps us to be discerning so that we can glean the truth from the lies (as well as “goodness from evil” and “beauty from ugliness”) in the books that we read.
<br>

To establish the rudimentary bearings of a Biblical worldview, Reinke asks and answers seven basic philosophical questions:
<br>

-   Does God Exist?
    -   God is self-subsisting
    -   God is self-sufficient
    -   God is all-sufficient
<br>

-   Does Truth Exist?
    -   “Jesus Christ is the eternal truth… He is the point where God, man, words, meaning, reality, and truth all converge."
<br>

-   Where Did Our World Come From?
<br>

-   What Went Wrong With Our World?
<br>

-   Who Are We?
    -   “Man is ‘both the glory and the garbage of the universe.’"
    -   “‘We are Rembrandt and Hitler, Mozart and Stalin, Antigone and Lady Macbeth, Ruth and Jezebel.’ Evidence for the glory and man, and for the sinful garbage of man, can be found throughout Scripture."
<br>

-   What Is The Solution To Our Problem?
<br>

-   Where Is The World Headed?

“The Biblical Worldview is like a touchstone to determine the value of gold.” If we want to be good gatekeepers of our souls, we must consider all that we read in light of the points of our worldview.  
<br>

“The touchstone proposition acts as the gatekeeper to the house of knowledge—or so it is hoped. What we count as knowledge has to pass the quality control of the touchstone proposition…Frames of reference have both a positive and a negative function: they attempt to explain and to exclude."
<br>

We should read non-Christian books because there is always at least some truth to be gained by them. “Non-Christian worldviews, no matter how faulty, are rarely (if ever) entirely false…The best non-Christian worldviews may include truth, but those random truths will never reveal the scope of God’s saving plan."
<br>

We should “read with skepticism, refusing to accept human ideologies as authoritative, recognizing just how incomplete they are, and supplementing what they say with the larger truths found in Scripture."
<br>

As long as we’re aware that the books we’re reading present faulty worldviews, we can sufficiently guard ourselves from what is false in them. Side note: this is why heresy is so dangerous, because it presents itself as Christian Truth. T.S. Eliot: “So long as we are conscious of the gulf fixed between ourselves and the greater part of contemporary literature, we are more or less protected from being harmed by it, and are in a position to extract from it what good it has to offer us."
<br>

“By clutching to a worldview that is based on Scripture, we set the agenda” when we read book, choosing what to accept or not.
<br>

Some guidelines on books to avoid:

- Avoid Certain Books Because Of Timing
- Avoid Certain Books that Glorify Evil
- Avoid Certain Books For Conscience’s Sake

“A firm grasp of biblical worldview, learned directly from the study of Scripture, is essential for a Christian book reader because distortions to the biblical worldview can be found on every shelf in the bookstore."
<br>

“A biblical worldview, informed by the touchstone propositions of Scripture, is what distinguishes Christian readers from non-Christian readers. It equips us to see and treasure the truth, goodness, and beauty in Christian books (the books on our side of the canyon. And the biblical worldview helps us see and treasure the truth, goodness, and beauty in non-Christian books (the books on the other side of the canyon)."
<br>

### Chapter 5: The Giver’s Voice: Seven Benefits of Reading Non-Christian Books

The best secular books contain truth in them, and that truth can be used by Christians and is important for them to know.
<br>

If we broad-brush all secular books as worldly and as having nothing to offer us, we’re offending the Spirit, who is the giver of all truth, even to those who are not believers.

The Seven Benefits:
1.  Non-Christian Literature can describe the world, how it functions, and how to subdue it
    -   This skill is given to all humankind, not just Christians
<br>

2.  Non-Christian books highlight the common life experiences
    -   “We can read and appreciate the human-ness of Christian Literature."
<br>

3.  Non-Christian Books can expose the human heart  
<br>

4.  Non-Christian Books can teach us wisdom and valuable moral lessons
    -   “The holy nation of Israel in the OT made use of the available pagan wisdom”, as evidenced in the Epic of Gilgamesh and Paul’s sermon in Acts 17
<br>

5.  Non-Christian Books can capture beauty
    -   “'Literature and art are God’s gifts to the human race,'” writes literature scholar Leland Ryken. ‘One of the liberating effects of letting ourselves ‘’go’’ as we enjoy literature is to realize that we can partly affirm the value of literature whose content or worldview we dislike. If God is the ultimate source of all beauty and artistry, then the artistic dimension of literature is the point at which Christians can be unreserved in their enthusiasm for the works of non-Christian writers.' … Our freedom to enjoy the aesthetic beauty of non-Christian literature does not require us to first endorse the author’s worldview or ethical choices."
<br>

6.  Non-Christian Literature begs questions that can only be resolved in Christ (this seems a continuation of benefit 3)
    -   Even though pagan practices are, well, pagan, there is an element of truth and a “genuine spiritual impulse to worship.” Writes Bavinck, "‘Christianity is not only positioned antithetically toward paganism; it is also paganism’s fuilfillment.’"
    -   Therefore its not good to _only_ position ourselves antithetically to non-Christian impulses of our culture.
<br>

7.  Non-Christian Books can echo spiritual truth and edify the soul
    -   Basil and Augustine encouraged secular learning, and to glean the truth from those worldviews; since Christianity is all truth, the truth that the pagans come up with is better suited to fit in a Christian worldview.
    -   Calvin critiques one of Plato’s prayers to King Jupiter: “King Jupiter, bestow the best things upon us whether we wish for them or not, but command that evil things be far from us even when we request them.” “Plato laments that his own prayers to the mythical god Jupiter were ironically self-defeating.” Calvin says, “The heathen man is wise in that he judges how dangerous is it to seek from the Lord what our greed dictates; at the same time he discloses our unhappiness, in that we cannot even open our mouths before God without danger unless the Spirit instructs us in the right pattern for prayer."

### Chapter 6: The God Who Slays Dragons: The Purifying Power Of A Christian Imagination

This chapter’s goal is to encourage us to use our imaginations to “see” certain realities (here he argues for Biblical realities) clearer.  
<br>

Reinke introduces two kinds of imagination:
- *Primary* Imagination is used when we imagine something mundane. This doesn’t use much imagination at all.
- *Secondary* Imagination is used when we imagine something amazing, ridiculous, and memorable. This takes much more effort and is more rewarding, Reinke seems to imply.
<br>

“God has given us the ability to ‘see’ in our minds things that we have never experienced."
<br>

“In this chapter I argue that our secondary imagination is essential for our pursuit of godliness, and that it’s a skill we can sharpen by reading."
<br>

Reinke says that the Gospel is God at His most imaginative and ingenious: “So ingenious is the gospel plan, that when men and Satan conspired to kill and bury the Savior, they only hastened the Father’s plan for His Son’s victory. This entire plan developed in God’s imagination long before the world existed (Eph. 3:7-10, 1 Peter 1:18-20).” Reinke implies this is a communicable attribute of God, for we, “with our imaginations, we can now ’see’ eternal reality (2 Cor. 4:8) (emphasis mine)."
<br>

He goes on to examine various portions of Revelation that involve a good bit of symbolism, and this require a good bit of imagination to “see.” He argues that this symbolism, when meditated on, creates an image (as opposed to the idolatrous and time-wasting images of Chapter 3); this image “stuns us in a way that a simple declaration [i.e. a doctrinal truth, I guess] cannot."
<br>

“Throughout the book of Revelation God wants us to ‘see’ with the eyes of our imagination the deeper and unseen powers at work….The imagery in Revelation was written to make us holy."
<br>

Bottom-line is clear: We need to cultivate our imaginations!
