I am working my way through Psalm 119, and the Lord helped me as I had trouble focusing this morning.

After a troubling time of prayer, I asked myself, **What does each verse say or imply about God's word?** The Lord used this question to springboard my meditations.

The first bullet under each verse is a straightforward answer to that question, with expanded thoughts, prayers and cross-references following.

33. _Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes; and I will keep it to the end._
- The statutes of the Lord belong to a **pathway**.
  - Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it” - Isaiah 30:21 (cf 119:35)
  - LXX translates way as ὁδὸν; used in Matthew 10:5 where Jesus explicitly tells the disciples which way to take
    - I thank You, my Jesus, that You teach me the way of (from) the Father by teaching me Your word.
- It is possible to keep God's law.
  - of course not perfectly, but blamelessly (119:3, Job 1:1)
    - What a wonderful encouragement; I _can_ walk in Your ways, my Holy One.
34. _Give me understanding, that I may keep Your law and observe it with my whole heart._
- The law of the Lord requires **understanding** to be kept.
  - Who gives this understanding but You, oh Spirit? Please give this to me. I know You do and You will, for David's prayer here surely cannot be frustrated.
- The law of the Lord is to be observed with our **whole heart**.
  - Show me, my Lord, when my obedience is halfhearted; convict me and lead me to repentance.
  - Your law, my Lord, is meant to be observed with my heart, not my head or my hands alone. Your law leads me to Yourself, for You are the Lawgiver.
35. _Lead me in the path of Your commandments, for I delight in it._
- God is able to **lead** me in this path of obedience.
- The commandments of the Lord are able to **delight** me.
  - Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts. Jeremiah 15:16
  - Help me to taste and see that Your words are sweet to my soul, sweeter than honey.
36. _Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to selfish gain!_
- God is able to **incline** my heart to His testimonies.
  - You are sovereign, my God! You are able to incline my heart towards Your law, towards Yourself, when my soul clings to the dust.
- One who follows God's law will not be inclined towards selfish gain.
  - My Lord, how can I keep my way pure, free from selfish gain? Teach me Your law, that my heart may be content in Your provision for me. Let me not seek gain in the obvious ways - money, power etc. Let me not seek gain in the non-obvious ways as well.
37. _Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in Your ways._
- God has power to turn my **eyes** from worthless things.
  - Lord, Your power can **turn my eyes** away. You know that lust is a dangerous sin-beast; please turn my eyes from it when I find the sensual allurements of the world in front of me, that I may not meditate on them. Please, fix my eyes on all Your commandments instead.
- The ways of God bring **life**.
  - If gazing at worthless things brings death, then gazing at Your ways brings life. I know that You will purify me with the pure, unfiltered light of Your face in due time (Psalm 17:15, 2 Corinthians 3:18, Revelation 22:4).
38. _Confirm to Your servant Your promise, that You may be feared._
- Your promises can be **confirmed** to me; moreover, You can confirm Your promise to me! 
- cf Hebrews 6:13-20 - _For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater by whom to swear, He swore by Himself, saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you." And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of promise the unchangeable character of His purpose, He guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us._
- My Lord! How beautiful! **The objective confirmation of Your promises can be felt subjectively**; for surely this is what David prays for! Let me dwell on this thought frequently today, my Holy One.
- My Lord, the same faith that Abraham had, and for which he was commended, is the same faith David prays for, and it is the same faith I can have in Your promises too.
39. *Turn away the reproach that I dread, for Your rules are good.*
- What is this reproach that David dreads? What is reproach?
  - Reproach is social disapproval. Elsewhere in the psalm David says that princes plot against him (119:23). Whatever this reproach is, it must be related to God's word.
  - "The **reproach**es of those who reproach You have fallen on me", Psalm 69:9
  - "Therefore let us go outside the camp and bear the **reproach** He endured." Hebrews 13:13
- The rules of the Lord are **good**.
40. *Behold, I long for Your precepts; in Your righteousness give me life!*
- God's precepts can be **longed** after.
- The Lord's righteousness gives life.
	- Give reviving as I sit and meditate, my Lord.
