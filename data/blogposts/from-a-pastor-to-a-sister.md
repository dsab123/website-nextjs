_"When we are dead and gone let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men."_ - Spurgeon

Samuel Rutherford's letters, many of which he wrote to members of his congregation while in captivity for his polemical political writings, are sweet to the soul.

When I am spiritually weak or slothful, or when my heart needs a fresh accessible portrait of Christ's beauty, I turn to these letters. One or two of these provide great a spiritual shot in the arm to move my heart to praise and prayer.

This morning I read one particularly moving letter that Rutherford wrote to one Jonet Maccullogh, a sister in his congregation, whose family was beloved to Rutherford's.

---------

_DEAR SISTER, - Grace, mercy, and peace be to you. I long to hear how your soul prospereth._

_I am as well as a prisoner of Christ can be, feasted and made fat with the comforts of God. Christ's kisses are made sweeter to my soul than ever they were. I would not change my Master with all the kings of clar upon the earth. Oh! my Well-Beloved is altogether lovely and loving. I care not what flesh can do._

_I persuade my soul that I delivered the truth of Christ to you. Slip not from it, for any bosts or fear of men. If ye go against the truth of Christ that I now suffer for, I shall bear witness against you in the day of Christ._

_Sister, fasten your grip fast on Christ. Follow now the guises of this sinful world. Let not this clay portion of earth take up your soul: it is the portion of bastards, and ye are a child of God; and, therefore, seek your Father's heritage. Send up your heart to see the dwelling hosue and fair rooms in the New City. Fy, fy upon those who cry, "Up with the world and down with conscience and heaven!" We have bairn's (child's) wits, and therefore we cannot prize Christ aright. Counsel your husband, and mother, to make them ready for eternity. That day is drawing nigh._

We should highlight a few emphases of this letter.

First are the inescapable allusions to the Scriptures.
- _"your soul prospereth"_ is drawn from 3 John 2: _Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth._"
- "_I care not what flesh can do_" - see Psalm 118:6  - "_The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?_"
- "_my Well-Beloved is altogether lovely_" is taken from Song of Solomon 5:16 - "_he is altogether lovely._"
- the phrase "_witness against you_" is used often in Scripture, most notably in Moses's warning to the Israelite people in Deuteronomy 4:26. James 5:3 uses this phrase also.
- This is not to mention the more indirect allusions, like Rutherford's counsel to draw up the eye of faith to the "dwelling house and fair rooms", a la John 14:2 - "_In my Father's house are many mansions._"

Second are the necessary Gospel encouragements. Notice the warning at the end of the second paragraph. Rutherford promises to bear witness against her if she turn from the "truth of Christ." What a warning to receive from your pastor! Nevertheless, this is good and proper for a congregant to hear, for this is the same warning that Paul wrote to the Jewish congregations in Hebrews 6 (_yes, Paul wrote Hebrews_). However harsh the warning, like Paul, Rutherford is convinced of better things in this sister, as the rest of the letter assumes and explicitly states that she is a child of God. Warnings are good and right for believers to hear, though they sting a little bit.

Another Gospel encouragement in the letter is his exhortation to be separate from the world. Rutherford calls those apart from Christ "_bastards_", who take up their earthly portion of clay relative to Christ's feasts. Rather than meddle in earthly things, he reminds her of her eschatology. Christ is seated in the heavenly places now, and every believer is there with Him - not in a sentimental fashion, but in as real a fashion as our conversion (Ephesians 2:6).

Thirdly, Rutherford spurs the sister on to proper evangelism and discipleship, to those in her family. It is curious why Rutherford did not write the letter to the father of the household. Perhaps he was sluggish in faith, while the faith of his wife was more lively.

We all ebb and flow in our spiritual lives; if you need a kick-start to awaken your heart to Christ's beauty and realities, may these letters be a strong help to you.
