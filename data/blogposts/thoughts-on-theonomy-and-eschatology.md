Dr. Richard Gaffin wrote a helpful essay on Postmillenialism during its resurgence in the 90's. You can read it [here](https://5mt.newhopefairfax.org/2025/04/Gaffin-Theonomy-and-Eschatology.pdf).

The postmillennial view seriously de-eschatologizes the present age of the church. By locating the eschatological center of gravity of the church in the future, they reduce the heavenly nature of the church now. "Emphasis on the golden era as being entirely future leaves the unmistakable impression that the church's present (and past) is something other than golden, that so far in its history the church has been less than victorious." p 4

Every epochal stage in the church's (and the world's) development - Christ's incarnation, resurrection, ascension, and Pentecost (the coming of Christ in the Spirit), save Christ's bodily return, has happened. And no other epochal event can happen than the return of Christ. The Christianization of the world cannot be one of these events, because it is tied to the church's future without regard to Christ Himself. (does this make sense?) "Where an attempt is made to locate the climactic eschatological event(s) prior to Christ's return at a point still in the suture for the church, then all that precedes necessarily (in terms of fundamental biblical structure) forfeits its eschatological character." p 6 ... "Any set of developments in the interim between Christ's resurrection and return, however otherwise significant, perhaps even momentous, can be of no more than subordinate, derivative importance eschatologically." p 8

The postmillennial view also defines the church's victory in worldly terms. For the Apostle, in 2 Corinthians 4:7ff and Philippians 3:10, the victory of the church (manifesting in "the life of Jesus") necessarily coexists with what looks like losing to the world ("the dying of Jesus"). "Until the resurrection of the body at his return Christ's resurrection-life finds expression in the church's sufferings; the locus of the Christ's ascension-power is the suffering church." p 10

Is not the pilgrim-suffering status of the church one of the most basic ones, explained in passages like 2 Timothy 3:12, Philippians 1:29, and the aforementioned ones? If the church were to gain a primacy in the world, then how would the suffering status of the church continue to be a reality? It wouldn't.

The postmillenianial view will give primacy to Old Testament prophecies such as the end of Isaiah 65 and Psalm 110, exegeting them without including the cruciform-shaped pattern of victory laid out for us by the Lord Jesus in the New. This approach reveals a fundamental Biblical-theological error, as it does not weigh the clearer later revelation in proper proportion to those of the relatively less clear Old Testament. 

In fact, the book of Revelation itself describes if anything, the opposite of a victorious church, at least as the world would define victory. Revelation 20:7-9 actually describes the church seemingly defeated before the Lord returns:

> _And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them_

Far from a Christianization of the world, John was preparing the church to suffer until the end. This is where the helpful Reformed paradigm of the already and not yet helps us. Paul teaches us that we are "seated with Christ in the heavenly places", Ephesians 2:6. He says this to believers who were alive on earth. These Christians, and by extension all Christians, are in heaven _right now_ with the Lord, even as we are on the earth now. We suffer the effects of sin, the fall and our own creatureliness. But we still reign with Christ _as_, even _because_ we suffer.

-----

I fear that the postmillenial view may provide an easy on-ramp to the disillusionment felt by the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, who wondered why Jesus did not reveal Himself as an earthly king with a political-military rule. His Kingdom is not of this world; it has been inaugurated and is here, but has not come in its fullness yet. 

The Kingdom will only come when the King returns, and until then His subjects will be foreigners. Victorious yes, but foreigners still. Just like our father Abraham.
