_The Christian is a man, according to Peter, who lives with his heavenly destiny ever in full view. His outlook is not bounded by the present life and the present world. He sees that which is and that which is to come in their true proportions and in their proper perspective. The center of gravity of his consciousness lies not in the present but in the future. __Hope, not possession, is that which gives tone and color to his life.__ His is the frame of mind of the heir who knows himself entitled to large treasures upon which he will enter at a definite point in time, treasures which will enable him to become a man and develop his powers to their full capacity; and every one of whose thoughts therefore projects itself into the period when he shall have become of age and enjoy the fruition of his hope._ (emphasis mine)

From [_Grace and Glory_](https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/grace-and-glory-sermons-preached-at-princeton-seminary-9781848719187), Geerhardus Vos, p 142.

The excerpt above is from [Geerhardus Vos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geerhardus_Vos)'s sermon on 1 Peter 1:3-5: _"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."_

The Lord Jesus intimated this heavenly-forward mind quite deliberately in His Beatitudes, though it is not immediately obvious:

> _Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._

> _Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted._

>_Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth._

>_Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied._

>_Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy._

>_Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God._

>_Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God._

>_Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._

> _Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you._

Matthew 5:3-11

What is given to the Christian, his current possession right now, is the Kingdom of God. In verses 3 and 10, the bookends of the Beatitudes 'proper', the predicate of each verse is a present-tense possession. In both cases it is the kingdom of God. Right now, on earth, ours _is_ the kingdom of heaven. And verse 12 speaks of our reward _being_ great now, but being in heaven, to be enjoyed at the last time. We might say that our reward is already there, but we are not there yet.

The future tense of the other Beatitudes' predicates mean that right now, we will not have fullness of comfort, we will not inherit the earth, we will not be satisfied in our longings for righteousness, we will not receive fullness of mercy, we will not fully see God and we are not _yet_ sons of God <sup>1</sup>. But we will be soon, not least because we are in possession of that great Kingdom. Our salvation "ready to be revealed in the last time" is inclusive of all of those things that we only have in part now.

The Gray Havens have ruggedized and practicalized this outlook of hope in their song _'Take This Slowly'_

> _If I took all that I got_

> _And spread it out on this table_

> _It might not seem like alot_

> _A once glimmering joy_

> _Slowly fading from view_

> _All the change in my pockets, not enough_

> _And this picture of you_

> _Still Iâ€™ve heard all that I have_

> _In the moment is hardly a sign_

> _Of everything coming my way_

> _I believe when I need it, it will be mine_
<br />

> _So let's take this slowly_

> _All I need is coming_

> _But it's just beyond what I can see._

1\. Paul explains that we are guaranteed the adoption as sons, but have not received it _fully_ yet: "And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."
