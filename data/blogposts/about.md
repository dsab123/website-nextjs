## This blog is not really for you. It's for me.


### Why

I used to do a lot of writing, but never published it to the wider internet.

In my current stage of my life, I find it a lot harder to write, so this blog is my attempt at keeping myself honest and writing more regularly. I don't put much work into distributing or marketing my content, so if you've found it and you're not a bot, you've likely already done a bit of searching. 

If so, I'd love to hear from you!

### What

These are mostly theological musings, pieces written more or less completely. When I need to think something through I'll push it to these internets to force myself to articulate my thoughts clearly.

### Who

I'm a Christian, member at [Acacia Reformed Church](https://arcopc.org) and have been married to the love of my life for <DaysMarried /> days, with many little children.
