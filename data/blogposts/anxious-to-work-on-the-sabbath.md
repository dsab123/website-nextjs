This is a short meditation based [O. Palmer Robertson, _Christ of the Consummation_](), pp 253ff

> _The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments._

> _On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment._

> _But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared._

Luke 23:55-24:1

The Lord can use the example of these women to encourage us obey His command to rest on the Lord's Day.

If you were one of those women, a devoted follower of Jesus, what could be more pressing than anointing the body of the Lord Jesus with oil?

The women worked diligently before and after the Sabbath, so that in this harrowing circumstance, the burial of their Lord Jesus, they could obey God's command to rest. They worked quickly enough to prepare enough spices the day before the Sabbath. And then, rather than do that most important work of caring for His body, they rested. Only after the Sabbath do they go and do the work, rising early. To their joy they discover the resurrected Lord! What a reward for obeying God's law in faith.

This is a good model for us to follow when we're anxious to do things that don't need to be done on the Sabbath. When I am tempted to justify unnecessary work on the Sabbath, I can simply ask myself, "Is this work more important than anointing the body of my Lord Jesus with oil and spices?" Surely it is not. Surely we can trust the Lord to give us the patience to do it later.
