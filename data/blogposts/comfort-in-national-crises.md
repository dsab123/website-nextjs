The mid-1600's were a tumultuous time in England's history. The Emperor had been executed and the country descended into civil war.

William Bridge, a Puritan pastor, preached a sermon series on Psalm 42:11 -

> _Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet again praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God._

In this excerpt he deals with those who are downcast due to the state of the nation. Building on passages from Isaiah and Revelation, real gospel comfort is held out to his original audience, and to us as well in our day.

You may say, Though a Christian has no reason to be discouraged in regard of his own private affliction, yet has he not reason to be discouraged when it goes ill in public affairs? And thus it is now with us; we see how it is with this poor nation; troubles and calamities press from every part; therefore I am discouraged; and have I not rcause to be cast down, and to be much disquited now?

Indeed, this is a sad thing; and oh, that we could weep day and night, and pray too, for this poor bleeding nation! If ever God's people here in England had cause to be afflicted, troubled, and humbled under the hand of the Lord, and to run together in prayer, surely they have reason now. Yet, says the Scripture, "Say to the righteous, in evil times, that it shall go well with him." Isaiah 3:10. Did ever any calamity come down like a storm upon a kingdom, but God did not provide some hiding place for His own children? Did He not provide and ark for Noah in the time of the flood, and a mountain for Lot in the time of the fire of Sodom? 

The worst that man can do is but to kill his neighbor. Death is the worst that can befall; and what is death, but an inlet to the eternal life unto the people of God? When the saints in the primitive times came to bear witness by their deaths unto the truth of Christ, then they said, _"Now we begin to be Christians indeed; now we begin to be like Christ. There is a three-fold death; spiritual death in sin, eternal death for sin, and temporal death which came in by sin. If God spare me from the two former deaths -- the spiritual death and the eternal death -- and only inflict the temporal death, have I any cause to complain?"_ Thus it is with the saints. Though they die temporally, yet they are free from the spiritual and eternal death; and what godly man may not say, I could not live long in nature, and shall I now bear witness unto the truth with this little spot of time that remains! 

Christ died for us, the Just for the unjust, and shall not I that am unjust be willing to die for the Just! 

The worst of all is death; the worst of death is gain. 


If you look into the 7th of Revelation, you shall find what a glorious issue God gives unto all His poeple in the times of public troubles: verse 9, _"After this I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands."_ A robe is a garment of majesty, palms are a [symbol] of victory; and says he, _I saw them with robes and palms_. The world looks upon God's servants as poor and of low spirits, but, says Christ, I look upon them as under a royal, princely garment, in robes and of a princely spirit...

There is a time coming when all tears shall be wiped away from our eyes; and therefore he adds this, at the 17th verse, _"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."_ How should tears be wiped away hereafter, if they were not shed for the present? 

Though, then, you do fear it now, and shed many tears, yet all shall be wiped away and not one left. Oh, what gracious dealing is here!

Thus will Christ deal with His people in troublous times; and therefore though your condition in regard of public affairs be exceeding sad, and very grievous, insomuch as we have all cause to mourn and weep, yet if you be in Christ, and have made your peace with God, you have no reason to be cast down.
