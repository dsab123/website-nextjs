We are working through this [book](https://tangibletheology.com/tangible-book/) for officer training at our [church](https://www.arcopc.org/), and I was tasked with leading the discussion on the book. Here are my thoughts and talking points.

If Part I explains why we need both word and deed to minister to those in need, Part II explains how we do it. And the effect of our ministry will result in our being a "living mystery ... [our life before the world] would not make sense if God did not exist." p 71

## General Thoughts 

As it applies to our church, I think this approach, namely, leading with actions (i.e. mercy ministry) that create opportunities for gospel conversations is much easier than the pain-line-crossing work of starting gospel conversations at the farmers' market.

We are small, and a church plant. Many of his examples (providing food or clothes for the needy via a formal church ministry, building ramps for wheelchairs, etc) are simply not implementable for us yet. While we should be working towards these things as a corporate body, we can all "do smaller works than these" because we're all little-d deacons, and the Lord must have ordained these good works for us to walk in, Ephesians 2:10. 

It would be good to pray regularly for opportunities to minister to others in need.

## Outline

### Chapter 6 - Names
- Melodic Line - As we minister to others we can invoke one of God's Names in Scripture as a pointer to the ultimate Name - Yahweh is (provides) Salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus for our sins.
- Outline
	- "God is all this to you: if you hunger He is bread to you; if you thirst He is water to you; if you are in darkness, He is light to you." p 73 ❤️
	- Author's list of Names applied to God, either by Himself or others
		- "These descriptions of God tell us what He does for us" p 76
		- "The rest of this book is about how God can use you to reveal Himself in the tangible ways described by His names." p 76
	- Question 1 on p 84 - "Does a particular title or description of God on pp 75-76 mean something special to you? How has a need in your life helped you see God in a new way?"
	- Discussion of the Divine Name Yahweh, I Am Who I Am, or I Will Be There Howsoever I Will Be There
		- "I AM whatever my people need", p 79
		- "Adversity is our opportunity to learn God's sufficiency." p 80
	- The name Jesus, Yahweh is Salvation, as 'primary' Name of God
	- Variation on Question 3, p 84 - **How could you use your ministry to someone where you've invoked God's name of Shelter (Psalm 25:4) move from the recipient's temporary need to their eternal need?**

### Chapter 7 - Presence
- Melodic Line - Our presence is a continuation of Christ's presence, and so is our mercy ministry.
- Outline
	- Incarnational Ministry
		- "Your presence is a powerful response to people's doubts." p 86
		- "Jesus revealed Himself to Fabris - first through the deeds of church volunteers, then through the Word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit in his heart." p 87
			- Do we realize that God reveals Himself to unbelievers through ourselves?
	- Jesus' Loving Presence in the World
		- Just as God revealed Himself thriufj Jesus to the world during Jesus' earthly ministry, God now uses the church empowered by the Spirit to reveal Himself to the world.
		- **"What does tangible love look like? Think of it as incarnate words."** p 89
		- **When God's people provide food, hold your hand, pray with you, and give you hope, they can declare "Jesus loves you!" with authenticity. But it requires the investment of our time, talent and emotion. It requires our compassionate presence."** p 90
	- People or Paperwork?
	- Give Yourself
		- We must pour ourselves out for others (Isaiah 58:10). We can only do this because Jesus did this for us! The cost is high, but we've received lavish gifts from our Savior, more than enough to cover the cost.
	- "Often we look for the quickest, most efficient way to do things. But taking time to be with someone opens doors for conversation and builds relationship. How could you do more of that?" p 96.

### Chapter 8 - Proactivity
- Melodic Line - God was proactive in reaching us with His Mercy, we must replicate that proactivity in showing mercy to the needy.
- Outline
	- Proactive, Accommodating Kindness
		- "if the church is to imitate the Compassionate One, if we are to show the world God's accommodating kindness, we must accommodate ourselves to human need." p 99
		- Regarding the importing of widows on p 100 - "ministry is best when it is done within the church community". 
			- What opportunities that easily fold people in to worship on Sunday? Obviously this fellowship time!
				- Note that last session we expanded our definition of mercy ministry to include lonely professionals who don't have many material needs, but emotional and spiritual needs.
	- The Merciful, Proactive Pursuit of God 
		- God is proactive in His mercy, Exodus 33:19 - "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy."
	- Agape Love Draws Us Toward Need
	- **"Why is it important to remember that Jesus saved you by grace, not because you deserved it? How should that fact affect your service to others?"** p 106
	- "How could you be more proactive in pointing people to Christ?" p 106

### Chapter 9 - Yes, You
- Melodic Line - God can and will use you to reveal Himself to unbelievers, and while He does that you may certainly feel helpless; good.
- Outline
	- It's Okay to Feel Helpless
		- In The Feeding of the Five Thousand Jesus "have the disciples an impossible command and then showed them how to obey it" ... It was a teaching tool for both the crowd and His disciples. p 112, 113
			- **Have you ever felt helpless when ministering to someone? Is it a relief that Jesus gives you permission to feel this way in those moments?**
		- May we remember that to be weak is to be strong (Phil 4:12-13), and that God usually chooses the weak to advance His kingdom (1 Corinthians 1:27).

### Chapter 10 - Abiding
- Melodic Line - You must serve others out of the grace that You have received from the Lord.
- Outline
	- You Have to be Fed to Feed Others
		- We have to minister to others out of the ministry that we have received from the Lord.
