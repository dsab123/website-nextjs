Every year I like to keep a record of books that I've read. Its one way I stay engaged with my reading.

Of the books I read this year, here are my top 5. I’ve grouped them into the following categories - theology, practical, fiction, and prayer.

If you find any of them interesting, click on the picture of the book to purchase. And let me know what you pick up!

## Practical

### Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nKTDAj" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/rich-dad.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Rich dad book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: I read this book because I got married this year and I had no framework for how to think about money other than “spend less than what you make.”

Kiyosaki is an entrepreneur journeyman who has found financial success in many avenues — real estate, stocks and subscription services, to name a few. In _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ he chronicles his successes and failures, interleaving them with childhood memories of the worlds-apart financial advice he received from both his poor dad (his biological father) and rich dad (his best friend’s father). 

If you have little education about money, you’re probably more like the poor dad than the rich dad in the way you think about money. The poor dad works hard, gets a high-paying job, fights for raises all the time, yet still struggles with his finances. Kiyosaki offers you a few really good lessons to get you thinking in the rich dad mindset — knowing the difference between an asset and a liability, put off buying a house, not paying off bills immediately, going into strategic debt. I wouldn't echo all of his recommendations, especially the one about joining a multi-level marketing company. But taken as a whole he provides a beginner’s framework for thinking about money in unconventional ways.

### Antifragile by Nicholas Nassim Taleb

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://amzn.to/2LZkSsZ" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/antifragile.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="antifragile book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: I read this book on recommendation from a close brother in my local church.

What is the word for something that gets stronger the more you attack it? Nicholas Nassim Taleb coins a word to describe systems that exhibit this phenomenon - then takes you on a world-class exploration of everything that Antifragility means. After giving you a robust devotion of the term, he devotes the rest of the work to its implications, practical and otherwise - including how many times you should deadlift per week, why Switzerland is a well-governed country and where to buy your next pair of shoes.

Taleb is a well-read and erudite polymath whose nonfiction goes down as smoothly as the dessert wines he frequently consumes, his reward for having predicted the 2007 economic recession. He is a pleasure to read.

This book has reinforced my belief that the uncommon paths in life are usually the better ones to follow.

## Fiction

### The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://amzn.to/3avn6KR" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/the-moon-is-down.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="The moon is down book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: I like Steinbeck’s brand of historical fiction, and it was only a hundred pages long.

Steinbeck's fiction is enjoyable because of the way he draws you in with every interaction. You can feel the body language of each character. He brings out the ethos in each scene, to the point that you feel like you're there. So it is with _The Moon Is Down_, a short historical novel based on the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War II. He reimagines the country as a small peace-loving village with a small-town feel. This peace-loving village is subjected to a short yet brutal takeover, in which six young militiamen are killed and a town citizen publicly executed. The villagers are stunned and silenced after such an ordeal. But over time they pluck up their courage and resist the occupation. 

Steinbeck depicts both the tenacious freedom-loving spirit of the subdued villagers as well as the tired humanity of the Nazi soldiers. The former are initially afraid of their captors, but over time rally as one man against them. The latter are battle-worn and weary, wanting just to go home to their families.

This novel was the most printed piece of propaganda in occupied Europe during the war. Which is saying a lot for its popularity among those who were its subject.

## Prayer

### My Wife’s Prayer Journal

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://amzn.to/2KrNydI" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/confessions.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Confessions book" title="wait, that's not my wife's prayer journal" /></a></div>

**Why**: I read my wife’s prayer journal (with permission, of course) because I wanted to be encouraged by her prayer life.

There is untold benefit in reading a loved one's writing. It’s one thing to learn of an event in their past from their own lips, but another thing to read of their experience of that event in the moment. You gain a kind of experiential layer in your knowledge of them. 

This experiential knowledge is magnified if the writing is personal, as is my wife’s prayer journal. There’s something mystical about reading her prayers to God during the hard times of her life. Her heart’s cries were earnest and full of adoration to the Lord, even in the midst of pain. Her prayers have taught me how to pray.

Since you can't read my wife’s prayer journal (I won't let you), I'll recommend the prayer journal of another Christian saint. Saint Augustine lived during the first few hundred years of the New Testament Church. His ability to introspect has never been matched, and his prayers have encouraged countless saints through the centuries.
