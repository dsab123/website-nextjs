I’ve just read a fascinating book!
<br></br>

Untangling Emotions, by J. Alasdair Groves and Winston T. Smith, tries to tackle the not-enough-discussed topic of emotions from a biblical worldview, and aims to “show us how to properly engage with out emotions — even the more difficult ones like fear, anger, shame, guilt, and sorrow — so that we can better understand what they revel about our hearts and handle them wisely in everyday moments.”  
<br></br>

Both authors seem well-credentialed for the task; Groves is the executive director for the New England branch of the Christian Counseling & Educational Foundation (CCEF), while Smith is the rector of Saint Anne’s Church in Abington, Pennsylvania. Both have received MDiv’s from Westminster Theological Seminary. Their reformed perspective comes out in the book, possibly no stronger than in their import of the Augustinian “disordered loves” paradigm. They also hold strongly to the Imago Dei, the teaching that humans are made in the image of God and thus share some of His attributes.  
<br></br>

Rather than a traditional review, I’m going to walk through the first half of the book. Because its so good.  
<br></br>

There’s a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read) at the beginning of each chapter, for you fast-moving types.  
<br></br>

## Introduction — How Do You Feel about How You Feel?
_**TL;DR** - We don’t stop and consider why we feel certain emotions, but have been conditioned by our times to try to fix the bad feeling to make it go away. This is wrong because emotions are a gift from God._
<br></br>

We tend to ignore our emotions: “most of us don’t know (or even stop to ask) why we are feeling what we are feeling most of the time …It’s not that hard in this day and age to flat from Netflix to email to Facebook to your job and never land anywhere in between long enough to notice that you’re feeling anything (13).”
<br></br>

“Christians often see negative emotions, the ones we would describe as feeling ‘bad’, as signs of spiritual failure. Anxiety is proof that you don’t trust God. Grief is failure to rest in God’s good purposes for your life. Anger is plain old selfishness. It seems that Christians are never only dealing with negative emotions. Instead, every dark feeling also carries with it a sense of spiritual failure, guilt, and shame about having that dark feeling. As a result, negative emotions are to be squashed and repented of immediately, rather than explores, and should be expressed only when carefully monitored and controlled — preferably while wearing a hazmat suit (15).”
<br></br>

“Actually, Christians are sometimes uneasy even with positive emotions. Happiness must be scrutinized for fear of ‘loving the gift more than the giver’, meaning God. A sense of accomplishment or satisfaction over a job well done might be just a cover for pride or taking credit for something for which we were only instruments. If you feel good for too long, it could mean you are selfish and aren’t in tune with the needs of those around you (15).”
<br></br>

The intro ends with some “critical truths” about emotions that the authors want to get out to us early:
<br></br>
-   Emotions are a gift in that:
	- “Emotions are an essential way we bear God’s image (17)"  
    - There’s an appendix titled ‘Does God Really Feel?’ that deals with the question of whether or not we can say that God has emotions; this doctrine is called God’s Impassibility.
    -   “Jesus leads the way” in our understanding of our emotions:
	    -   “Jesus, who is fully God, also became fully human. That means that Jesus knows experiences emotions not only as God does but also as we do, as a flesh-and-blood human being. In the gospels we witness Jesus’s compassion for suffering and heartache. We see His anger as He speaks to callous religious leaders. We hear His groans as He grieves over unbelief and death (17,18)."
    -   “It’s all about love”: “Emotions flow out of what we love, and, at the same time, they actually help us to love the right things: God and one another (18).”
<br></br>

## 1 - Sometimes It’s Good to Feel Bad
_**TL;DR** - Negative emotions are a sign that we live in a fallen world, and should not be ignored or suppressed. Jesus did not do this with His own emotions!_
<br></br>

This first chapter offers the why to question that naturally arises behind a prior: Why do we feel negative emotions?
<br></br>

Following the second of the critical truths in the intro, the authors point us to Jesus, who wept at Lazarus’s funeral. “Now think about this: As God, Jesus controls the entire universe and can change anything at any time. In fact, He is going to raise Lazarus from the dead in around five minutes. Why on earth would Jesus weep when He’s about to do an amazing miracle and fix the problem (23)?”
<br></br>

If God Himself felt this way, then “a whole host of uncomfortable feelings can be deeply godly, right, and holy (26).”
<br></br>

“We don’t know how you picture Jesus, but your mental image is probably not of Him racked by sobs as tears run down His cheeks into His beard. Jesus bleeding on the cross yet forgiving His enemies? Sure. Jesus with children in His lap, smiling compassionately down? You bet. Jesus wailing loudly or shaking with silent tremors at [Lazarus's] funeral? Not so much. ... In the garden of Gethsemane Jesus trembles and sweats blood from some combination of dread, anguish, and loneliness (25, 27).” ❤️
<br></br>

As Jesus is the perfect human man, clearly there is nothing unnecessary or wrong in what He does. And if Jesus is able to express such negative, then so are we. And without guilt, I might add.
<br></br>

“The basic reason we [like Jesus] need negative, unpleasant emotions is that we live in a fallen world … Our negative emotions, like God’s, play a necessary role in our lives. They tell us that something is wrong… disgust, annoyance, discouragement, and fury are designed to identify places where this fallen world is fallen, where disorder, damage, and destruction have broken something we rightly hold precious (25).”
<br></br>

Yet we shouldn’t conflate the actual emotions themselves with the sometimes apparently-impossible-to-fight actions that flow from them. We’re not always “[pointed] in the right direction” when we take action to alleviate or express these emotions (27).
<br></br>

## 2 - What Exactly Are Emotions?
_**TL;DR** - Motivations Communicate what we value, are one way we Relate to others, Motivate us to action, and Elevate our hearts in worship to God._
<br></br>

The discussion of what emotions actually are has a long and storied history, of which the authors spend about two pages discussing. Plato, Aquinas, Pascal, bla bla bla. Do they come from the body, or the mind? “Probably both”, the authors answer (32).
<br></br>

(If Taylor were writing this, you might expect a discussion of gnosticism at this point.)
<br></br>

“More important to the Bible than where our emotions come from, however, is what our emotions do (32).”
<br></br>

Emotions do four things:
<br></br>

 1. **Communicate**: Emotions Communicate Value
	-   “Your emotions are always expressing the things you love, value, and treasure, whether you understand them or not (35).”        
2. **Relate**: Emotions Help Us to Connect
	-  Sharing our emotions with one another, as Jesus did with Lazarus’s family members, is vital to forming strong and lasting relationships (36).
 3. **Motivate**: Emotions Motivate Us
	-    “This motivational aspect of our emotions is God’s way of helping us put our values into action … our emotions are constantly spurring us to further God’s purposes in our lives (37).”   
 4. **Elevate**: Emotions Turn Us Toward God
	- “Emotions are an expression of worship … every emotion that you ever feel reflects your loves, or what you worship (38, 39).”  
    -   Of course, whether we are worshipping God or another object is an important question: “Sometimes our worship is off. We love the wrong thing, or maybe we love the right things in the wrong way or too much. Not everything we feel flows from a value for what God loves, but every point on our whole spectrum of emotions was designed to send us sprinting to our Father with words like ’thank you’, ‘help me’, ‘you’re amazing’, or ‘oh no!’ No feeling is beyond redemption (39, 40)."
<br></br>

## 3 - Emotions Don’t Come in Single File
_**TL;DR** - We feel many emotions at once because of the mixed nature of our experiences in this fallen world. Jesus Himself experienced the same. While we should attempt to understand what experiences cause our emotions in the main, we can’t do this exhaustively._
<br></br>

Even though we’ve learned what emotions do, we will still have trouble identifying and acting on them. They’re still confusing, simply because “[We] love lots of things,” sometimes even conflicting things. Discerning a root cause of a particular emotion, therefore, is quite a complex endeavor.
<br></br>

That’s because our emotions don’t only interact with us, but they interact with each other.
<br></br>

“Most people respond to this complexity by oversimplifying in one of two basic ways (42).” Either we ignore them altogether, or we focus intensely on them, “which tend to dominate everything else in their lives — and deal with them by hunting down a bad guy to blame (43).”
-   I’m in the second camp here; for us second-campers, our authors offer some striking and helpful identifications: “Sometimes these people condemn themselves as the bad guy. Because I have a negative emotional reaction, the thinking goes, there just be something wrong with me (43, emphasis mine).” Or, if we’re not the bad guy, it’s someone else that we should henceforth steer clear from. “Even though those who feel this way may be aware of their emotions, they’re often confused about why they feel upset (43).”
<br></br>

Again Groves and Smith take their cue from the life of the Lord Jesus, who “was Himself no stranger to mixed emotions” to help us understand that this is not a sinful thing: “Think yet again about Jesus’s grief at the tomb of Lazarus. Jesus loved Mary, so He grieved her loss. But He also hated sin and death, so He felt deep anger. Further, He had already told the disciples that this miracle was going to be a great blessing to their faith, and, because He loved them too, He also felt some level of excitement tin the background for the good this would do them (44, 45).”
<br></br>

“Mixed emotions are the right response to a mixed world (45).”
<br></br>

The authors offer a helpful mental picture for understanding how our emotions interact with one another: streams of paint flowing into a bucket. “Your emotional state at any moment is like that paint bucket with streams pouring into it from your heart. Your heart is pouring out a stream of emotion (sometimes just a trickle, sometimes as a torrent) for every care you have. … Your heart has thousands of different pipes carrying color into the mix of what you feel. Thus, your emotions at any moment are a mix of your responses to everything around you! You’re influenced by whether it is sunny or cloudy, whether your job is going well or poorly, whether your kids slept well last night or were up a light, whether you had a refreshing devotional time that softened your heart toward the Lord”, down to the quality of the sandwich you ate for lunch, and so on and so forth (47). What’s more, these different colors are all swirling into one bucket. “The way you answer the question How are you feeling? is going to be your attempt to capture all those swirling, intermingling colors in one big summary (48).”
<br></br>

Now that we understand this complexity in broad strokes (paint pun haha), we end this chapter with two exhortations:
<br></br>

1.  “We want to understand as much as we can about anything in our emotional buckets (50).” The more we know about what’s causing our emotions, the better. Sometimes this is easy for the colors that are coming in full-stream into our emotional bucket, and harder for the subtle drip-drip of our lesser-felt emotions.
3.  “We need to remember that we will never exhaustively understand all the streams from out hearts into our emotions, and we don’t need to! (50, emphasis mine).”
	-   “Instead, all we need to do is bring whatever we do manage to understand to God and entrust Him with all the hidden corners of our hearts, loves, and feelings that we can’t see into but He knows perfectly (50).”
<br></br>

## 4 - Emotions Happen in Your Body
_**TL;DR** - Our bodies’ response to our experiences have an instinctive effect on our minds, but this is not the end-all, be-all in our quest to understand our emotions._
<br></br>

Our bodies affect the way we feel. This is obvious, of course. It’s scientifically proven that regular exercise staves off depression and makes us feel good, for example.
<br></br>

As an aside, James K. Smith writes in You Are What You Love (continuing the “disordered loves” train of thought) that Western society wrongly views humans as brains-on-sticks: to defeat a particular sin, or teach proper manners, you just have to impart the correct information (or data), into yourself or the person you’re teaching, and voila! problem solved. But we know from experience that we don’t work that way. We’re not just brains-on-sticks. We’re embodied brains,  you could say, and our bodies affect the way we process all our thoughts and emotions.
<br></br>

There are three main ways our physiology can influence our emotions:
<br></br>

 1.  Too Fast or Too Slow
    -   “God made us to respond to the world around us in the moment, our hearts and bodies responding to our construal of how our situation is affecting the things we most love. When our bodies rush or delay that reaction, we begin to drift out of rhythm with reality, and our emotions start to pull us away from worshipful, trusting obedience rattan than toward it (57).”
    -   One page earlier our response and construal of our situations is described as instinctive; “this is another good and right aspect of God’s design! You were made to live out of love. The more you love, the more you’ll respond immediately when something affects what you love. Thus, when fear catapults you quicker than you thought towards your child who is stepping into the street, you are experiencing God’s blessing of instinctive emotions (56).”
 2. Too Long or Too Short
    -   “When our emotions either drain too quickly or stagnate, our bodies hinder rather than help us in responding to our situations. And we are more reliant on the physical help from our bodies’ emotions than we think” (59).”
		-   Helpful example: hours after getting out of your car, you still feel the tenseness of highway traffic.            
 3. Too Much or Too Little
	-   “Your body is constantly sending signals to your soul about how the world is going, and those messages become significantly problematic when they get pressed too hard, the glandular equivalent of a computer key getting stuuuuuck in the down position (61).”
<br></br>

It’s helpful to try to identify when emotions are coming too fast or too slow, persist too long or not long enough, or come with too much intensity or too little. But more often than not this is not obvious and hard to attain.
<br></br>

It’s important for us to remember that bodies are good, as having been created by God and literally pronounced “good” by Him. This is a call for a healthy appreciation for the fall’s effect on our bodies.
<br></br>

The authors end with comforting words to those of us second-campers from the previous chapter who throw up their hands in wondering what effect they can have on their bodies’ instinctive signals to their souls:
<br></br>

“What we need to remember is that even when our bodies are influencing our emotions and confusing the mixture, it doesn’t mean our hearts no longer matter or that the help of the living God and His Word have to take a back seat. It always makes a difference when we bring our hearts to Him and receive His grace, even if that is the grace to endure one more day of our body flooding us with a flat-gray numbness. God delights in the faith and honor we show Him when we seek to live in tune with His heart, no matter how turbulent or misguided our feelings may be (65).” ❤️
<br></br>

## 5 - You Relate to Others When You Feel with Them
<br></br>

TL;DR - As Christians, we should learn to feel with others.
<br></br>

This short chapter picks up the Emotions Relate bullet from Chapter 2.
<br></br>

Pulling from 1 Corinthians, the authors explain that christians are one body with each other, so when your brother or sister is suffering, it is important to enter into their suffering and try as best you can to feel with them, to feel what they are feeling. This is the proper expression of the 1 Corinthians 13 love that bears all things for another.
<br></br>

“As you listen don’t fight the discomfort of not being in control or able to make them feel different (70).”
<br></br>

“Learning to connect with other people is a skill well worth learning. While emotional connection is not the only way we connect, this sharing of hearts and values and communicating a depth of care for others will be part fo our delight for the rest of our lives, even our lives in heaven. All the images we have of heaven are of people sharing the joy of delighting in the King on His throne, singing together, expressing their collective passion for all He has done and who He is. This is exactly what we’d expect, given that God Himself is a relationship — Father, Son, and Spirit — in which desires and delights are so mutually shared that Christ could rejoice in doing His Father’s will even though it killed Him.” ❤️
<br></br>

## 6 - Why Can’t I Control My Emotions?
<br></br>

_**TL;DR** - Psalm 42 is proof that emotions simply don’t come and go when we tell them to. Emotion-change comes along with heart-change, which God promises by His Spirit._
<br></br>

This is a really important chapter, one I had been waiting to get to ever since I read the its title in the table of contents.
<br></br>

“Why do we so often feel like our emotions are controlling us rather than the other way around? Why can’t we simply choose to feel different any time we want to (76)?”
<br></br>

Here’s an extended quote: “Some of the writers of the Bible experienced the frustration of trying to feel different but finding their emotions didn’t come and go at their beck and call. The author of Psalm 42 provides us with one of the clearest examples… He spends the psalm wrestling with his emotions, twice asking,
<br></br>

>Why are you cast down, O my soul,
and why are you in turmoil within me? (vv. 5, 11)
<br></br>

Even as he fights to remember the good things God has done and urges himself to hope in the Lord, his feelings seem to stay stuck, doggedly resisting his efforts to change them. This lack of immediate change in the psalmist’s feelings, however, doesn’t mean his battle with his feelings is pointless. Nor does it mean he’s fighting poorly. It simply means that he is human, and that the world around him must change at a significant level for his significant emotions to change. … God gave us emotions that are actually designed not to change unless what we love changes or what is happening to the thing we love changes (77).”
<br></br>

There is a section titled _Perfect Faith Doesn’t Mean Control over Emotions_, but it’s a classic bait-and-switch to keep reading. The authors promise to get into this more in future chapters, but “for now [they’ll] simply say that a vital, active relationship with a good and sovereign God matters a lot to your emotional life. We need to appreciate, however, that even when a relationship with God impacts your emotions, the way it does so is not by flattening them. Loving God more does not mean caring about others less! Instead, the way your relationship with God affects your emotions is by His Spirit constantly reshaping and refining what you love throughout your life (79).”
<br></br>

So, to change our emotions, our hearts and loves have to change. And God is the one who changes hearts. “Our hope for change in our emotions should always be focused on the hope promised by God that He can change our hearts. (80).”
<br></br>

## 7 - Two Pitfalls
<br></br>

_**TL;DR** - Church and culture at large tell us to either treat emotions as everything, or to suck them up and ignore or fight them. Both approaches are unhelpful._
<br></br>

This chapter explains the two majority ways both the church and secular culture advocate dealing with emotions — and both are unhealthy.
<br></br>

The first option is the “Spit-It-Up, Emotions-Are-Everything” view, which expresses that “our emotions are everything, the most important thing, the thing that defines us (86).” Both the secular culture and the church in the western world have taken up this view in the main. The counsel of this camp is to express your emotions without abandon, and do whatever it takes to establish emotional equilibrium. “This is why we value ‘getting it off your chest’, ‘letting off steam’, ‘just being honest’, ’saying what you feel’, and so on (87).” This happens in the church when “the goal of the sermon is to feel deeply convicted or inspired; the goal of the music is to feel a rush of ecstasy or thanksgiving; the goal of coffee hour is to feel connected and included. This mentality also drives personal devotions as well (87).”
<br></br>

The second option is the “Suck-It-Up, “Emotions-Are-Nothing” approach. While less common, this view still has its strong adherents. “Zen Buddhist practice, which emphasizes the need to deal with the suffering of the world by emotionally distancing oneself from it” is one such example (89). “Presumably part of [this view’s] popularity derives from the way [it] effectively pushes back against the dominant narrative of emotions-are-everything which leaves people with no easy way to guard against the flood of emotions they feel (90).” However, this kind of “stoicism misses that emotions are a God-given gift, an aid in obedience, a constant occasion for connection with the Lord, and a vital source of information about the deeper problems of our hearts. … Instead of fighting dark feelings simply because they feel bad, we must carve out room in our theology for sadness, fear, anger, guilt, shame, dismay, and the like. Without them our faith becomes lopsided (91).”
<br></br>

## 8 - Engage: A Better Option
_**TL;DR** - Engaging emotions involves: Identifying that we are feeling something, Examining what it is we’re feeling, Evaluating the good and the bad in our emotions, and Acting on them, vivifying the good and mortifying the bad._
<br></br>

Rather than the Spit-It-Up or the Suck-It-Up approaches, the Bible offers what the authors have called engagement. “The Bible’s model of engaging emotions means something very simple: when an emotion comes on your radar, you look at it, see what you find, and then (not before!) decide how to respond (93).”
<br></br>

“The beauty of engaging is that it doesn’t judge your emotions ahead of time as either good or bad. When you engage something, you move closer and explore it, preparing yourself to deal with whatever you uncover. If, as we have argued thus far, there are good negative emotions (as well as bad) and bad positive emotions (as well as good), then it is imperative that we figure out what is going on before working to shut down or amplify the feelings flowing from our hearts (93).”
<br></br>

The process of engaging our emotions can be broken down into four steps:
<br></br>

 1.  **Identify**
		- “The point in this step is simple to become aware that something is occurring inside you (94).”   
		- “This is nothing magical or novel. You are simply trying to describe your reaction to the world God has put you in, using the words God has given. This is what the Bible does constantly. Thus the Gospels tell us that Jesus was ’sorrowful and troubled’ as His death approached (Matt. 26:37), or thankful to His Father for making the gospel accessible to even little children (Luke 10:21). And thus the psalmists tell us ‘My heart is struck down like grass and has withered (Ps. 102:4), or ‘I am weary with my crying out (Ps. 69:3), or ‘I will be glad and exult in You’ (Ps. 9:2). … Scripture’s first step in engaging emotions in the people it talks about is to simply identify their feelings (94, 95).”
 2.  **Examine**
	 -   “Your emotions are always telling you something about what you are valuing, caring about, or loving. What are they telling you? They are always saying something about your relationships. What are they saying? They are always pressing you toward some kind of action. What are they energizing you to do? … In other words, examining emotions entails asking questions like Why am I feeling this? What am I reacting to? Why is this hitting me so hard? Why isn’t this affecting me the way it usually does? and How is this emotion making me want to behave? (95).”
	 -   At this point, “you aren’t interested yet in whether what you’re seeing is good or bad; you’re just trying to understand what is going on. Whether what you see is a problem or not, you want to become as aware as possible of what you are caring about, how your are relating, and what you are doing in response (97).”
	 -   Personally, around this point in the process I’ve consciously tried to start feeling the emotion in its fullness. As the book has established, the feeling of certain emotions is not sinful. Trying to lean in and feel the emotion, rather than trying to brush it away, has helped me when trying to deal with it. I suppose this is because of my suck-it-up bent.
 3. **Evaluate**
	 -   “Once you have identified that something is happening inside you and examined what is going on in that feeling, you’re ready to take the next logical step: figuring which aspects of what you are feeling are good and godly and which are destructive or selfish. This is hard to do! You will rarely find only good in your emotions or only bad. Instead, you’ll almost always find good and bad mixed together (97).”
 4. **Act**
	-   “When you know that you are feeling, have named what you are feeling as best you can, and have decided which aspects of the feeling are good and which are bad, you are finally ready to act (98).”
	-   “While options for actions are endless, proper responses to emotions fall into two fundamental categories (97).”        
	-   We should aim to “embrace and nurture the loves of our heart and the behaviors that are good”, while “we want to resist and even starve loves and actions that are bad (97).”
