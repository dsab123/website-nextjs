*Prayer* by Keller is a very helpful book that collects the thoughts of Calvin, Luther, and Augustine on the subject of Prayer.
<br></br>

Below are a few of my gleanings from the book, with page numbers for reference.
<br></br>

Luther's recommended beginning prayer (p 71):
"Although...you could rightly and properly be a severe judge over us sinners...now through your mercy implant in our hearts a comforting trust in your fatherly love, and let us experience the sweet and pleasant savor of a childlike certainty that we may joyfully call you Father, knowing and loving you and calling on you in every trouble."
<br></br>
<br></br>

## Augustine's principles of prayer in his letter to Phoba (p 84ff):
- "You must count yourself desolate in the world" apart from Christ, his Disordered Loves theme
    - Eyes must be fixed on Christ as the only source of lasting peace, happiness, and joy
- "Pray for a happy life"
    - If you've grasped the first rule, your prayer will be like Psalm 27:4 in that our greatest desire would be to know Him more.
    - Even in asking for worldly needs, our ultimate desire is to keep Him as the First Love.
        - The Lord's Prayer as a good example of this
            - Proverbs 30:7-9 "reveals the only proper motive" behind the individual requests in the Lord's Prayer
- Now, we can begin to study the Lord's Prayer and "make sure all our appeals fit it"
    - "Once you have learn to pray in full awareness of the disorderedness of your heart and where true joys are found, he says, you can be guided in the specifics of how to pray by studying the Lord's Prayer."
        - Following this is a helpful analysis of its parts, ACTS (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Petition), etc.
- Regarding prayer in difficult times - when we are unsure how to pray, look to Jesus's prayer in Gethsemane
    - "Let this cup pass from me - nevertheless, not my will but thine be done"
        - Perfect balance of honest desire and submission
        - Romans 8:26 - we do not know what to pray for oftentimes, the Spirit helps us in our weakneses.
<br></br>

## Luther's little letter "A Simple Way to Pray" (p 89ff):
- Luther was a strong advocate of the cultivation of prayer as a habit through regular discipline, both at morning and evening
    - At morning, and at evening 
<br></br>

- Ways to focus our thoughts and to warm and engage our affections for prayer
    - Reciting the Ten Commandments, words of Christ, or some other passage as meditation, a "kind of bridge" between formal Bible study and prayer
    - The Garland Metaphor: how to meditate on the selected passage
        1. Discern the instruction of the text, i.e. interpretation
        2. Ponder how this teaching leads us to:
            - praise and thank God,
            - confess and repent of sin, and
            - appeal to God in petition and supplication
        3. This "generates a rich spectrum of insights that can be immediately lifted to God in prayer"
            - examples can be found on pp. 91, 92
        4. Work out the truth of the text in my relationship to God, to myself, and the World
    - Before launching into free prayer, pray and paraphrase the Lord's Prayer, "personalizing each one using my own needs and concerns"
    - Keep watch for the "preaching of the Spirit"
    - As He pleases, the Spirit may "fill our heart with rich thoughts and ideas that feel poignant" when doing any of the above steps
        - Listen to Him! Drop the rest of the routine, and dwell on the thoughts He imparts; cf Psalm 119:18, Ephesians 1:18
<br></br>

## Calvin's Rules for Prayer (p 97ff):
 1. We must have a joyful fear of communing with God
     - You have this joyful fear when you are genuinely afraid of doing anything to grieve or displease Him, not as avoiding warrant for punishment but out of sheer awe
     - "We tremble with the privilege of being in His Presence and with an intense longing to honor Him... [and are] deeply afraid of grieving Him."
 2. We must have a sense of our spiritual insufficiency
     - "Includes both a strong sense of our dependence on God, in general, and a readiness to recognize and repent of our own faults in particular."
     - "We must come to God with the 'disposition of a beggar'... drop all pretense, flee from all phoniness."
     - "To the degree you can shed this 'unreality' of self-sufficiency, to that degree your prayer life will become richer and deeper."
3. Restful and Submissive Trust
    - Jesus: “Thy Will be done."
    - [This is to say] "Here's what I need--but You know best."
    - Praying in this way brings comfort and rest.
4. Confident Hope
    - We should pray with a sure hope that our prayer will be answered
    - Seems contradictory to Submissive Trust? Calvin explains why this isn’t the case:
        1) God invites us to pray to Him and promises to answer prayers
        2) God often waits to give a blessing until you’ve prayed for it
            - In order to “make our hearts safe to receive [those blessings] through prayer”
            - Thus, these two rules aren’t contradictory but complimentary
            - We need to keep in mind that if God gave us everything we prayed for, we’d be miserable.  Augustine’s ‘Disordered Loves’ comes into play here again, of course.
            - God won’t give us anything that is contrary to His Will (Romans 8:28)
    - "We can, therefore, pray confidently because He won’t five us everything we want. 'He so tempers the outcome of events according to his incomprehensible plan that the prayers of the saints, which are a mixture of faith and error, are not nullified.'"
        - “Don’t be afraid that you will ask for the wrong thing. _Of course you will!_ God ‘tempers the outcome’ with his incomprehensible wisdom."
5) The Rule against Rules, i.e. The Rule of Grace
    - God regards those prayers “'in which He finds neither perfect faith nor repentance, together with a warmth of zeal and petitions rightly conceived’" because of His mercy.
    - “'No one has ever carried out [prayer] with the uprightness that was due … Without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray.’"
    - “Only when we see we cannot keep the rules, and need God’s mercy, can we become people who begin to keep the rules. The rules do not earn or merit God’s attention but rather align our prayers with who God is — the God of free grace — and thereby unite us to Him more and more."
        - God gives us this grace in Christ, who secures us an audience with God because of His claims on the Father.
    - “For as soon as God’s dread majesty comes to mind, we cannot but tremble and be driven far away by the recognition of our own unworthiness, until Christ comes forward as intermediary, to change the throne of dreadful glory into the throne of grace … ‘Hitherto,’ he says, ‘you have asked nothing in my name; ask and you will receive’ [John 16:24] … as Paul says, ‘All God’s promises find their yea and amen in Him’ [2 Cor 1:20]. That is, they are confirmed and fulfilled."

## The Prayer of Prayers, an Exposition on the Lord’s Prayer by Augustine, Luther, Calvin (p 108ff): 

(A = Augustine, L = Luther, C = Calvin)
<br></br>

- “Our Father Who Art In Heaven"
    - C: Calling God ‘Father’ means we are approaching Him as adopted “children of grace in Christ"
        - “‘By the great sweetness of this name [Father] He frees us from all distrust’"
    - L: This address calls us to pause and “realize our standing in Christ before we proceed"
        - He could be a severe judge over us, but because we are in Christ He is our loving Father
- "Hallowed Be Thy Name" 
    - L: His Name is already holy, but we are praying here that we would regard it as such
    - L & A: This is a petition that God’s name would be glorified in the nations, as its glorified in His Children
    - C: “‘What is more unworthy than for God’s glory to be obscured partly by our ungratefulness?’"
        - "We do not revere His name unless he ‘captivate[s] us with wonderment for Him.'"
- “Thy Kingdom Come"
    - A: We, as sinful humans, resist His Rule in our lives, and this is the cause of all problems in our lives and society
        - We need His Kingdom to ‘come’ so that we would fulfill our purpose rightly — to serve Him
    - C: There are two ways His Kingdom comes:
        - Through the Spirit, who corrects our desires'
        - Through the Word, which ‘shapes our thoughts'
    - We’re asking God to fully rule in us that we’d want to obey Him with joy in our hearts
    - L: we should look to the future where His reign would be fully realized on the earth, and long for that day
        - “ask that ‘Your future kingdom may be the end and consummation of the kingdom You have begun in us.’"
- “Thy Will Be Done"
    - L: “‘Grant us grace to bear willingly all sorts of sickness, poverty, disgrace, suffering, and adversity and to recognize that in this Your divine will is crucifying our will.’"
        - If we aren’t completely sure of God’s loving disposition towards us, it is hard to make such a bold statement
    - This is the part of the prayer Jesus prayed before His passion; “Jesus is not asking us to do anything for Him that He hasn’t already done for us, under conditions of difficulty beyond our comprehension."
    - C: “to pray ‘Thy will be done’ is to submit not only our wills to God but even our feelings, so that we don’t become despondent, bitter, and hardened by the things that befall us."
    - “If we can’t pray this petition from the bottom of our hearts, we will never know any peace, but will try to control our circumstanced, which is beyond our control.
<br></br>

“The beginning of prayer is all about God. We are not to let our own needs and issues dominate prayer; rather, we are to give pride of place to praising and honoring Him, to yearning to see His greatness and to see it acknowledged everywhere, and to aspiring to full love and obedience."
<br></br>

After this, once our heart has been healed of self-centeredness in this Adoration and Thanksgiving, we can turn to our own needs.
<br></br>

- “Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"
    - A: Full expression of this petition found in Proverbs 30:7-9
    - L: This includes prayer for society to take care of the poor, to pray against ‘wanton exploitation’ that deprives the poor of their necessities.
- “Forgive Us Our Debts As We Forgive Our Debtors"
    - Concerns relationships with God and others
    - “Unresolved bitterness is a sign that we are not right with God. It also means that if we are holding a grudge, we should see the hypocrisy of seeking forgiveness from God for sins of our own."
- “Lead Us Not Into Temptation"
    - "We pray that we would not entertain and consider the prospect of giving in to sin”, not that we would never be tempted.
    - A: this petition is for protection from the evil inside us
- “Deliver Us From Evil"
    - A: this petition is for protection from the evil outside us
- “For Thine Is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory Forever"
    - Only Calvin addresses this ‘inscription', as it was not in the Vulgate or the earliest manuscripts
    - C: We return to the truth of God’s complete sufficiency after descending into our own needs, troubles, and limitations.
<br></br>

Concluding remarks:
- The Lord’s Prayer is the perfect prototype; all our prayers should roughly follow the outline provided by it.
    - Luther’s method of paraphrasing the Lord’s Prayer twice a day is the best way to get in the habit of shaping our prayers after the structure given here.
- This prayer is given to us in plural form
    - Just as one person’s relationships with others brings out different facets of his personality, by seeing how others communicate with God, we can see how they view Him differently from us.
    - “If it takes a community to now an ordinary human being, how much more necessary would it be to get to know Jesus alongside others? By praying with friends, you will be able to hear and see facet of Jesus that you have not yet perceived."

## The Touchstones of Prayer (p 120ff):

The following are "twelve 'touchstones' by which we can judge the relative strength or weakness of our prayers for honoring and connecting us to God."
<br></br>

### What Prayer Is
- Work — Prayer is a Duty and Discipline
    - Should be done regularly and resolutely, even if no immediate effect is felt
    - "No Christian [fully] outgrows the need to struggle and persevere in prayer"
- Responding to the Word — Prayer is conversing with God
    - Understanding God as speaking to us through Scripture; proto-logical
    - Packer: "reading Scripture, thinking through what my reading shows me of God, and turning that vision into praise before I go further [into prayer]"
- Prayer is a balanced interaction of Praise, Confession, Thanks, and Petition
    - Each of these 'forms' is necessary for the others; one doesn't claim precedence over another
    - "When we comprehend God's greatness, it leads us to a new grasp of our own sinfulness. Then a deeper recognition and a repentance for sin issues in thankful wonder at God's grace. 'She who is forgiven much, loves much' (Luke 7:47)."
<br></br>

### What Prayer Requires
- Grace — Prayer must be in 'Jesus's Name', based on the Gospel
    - "... full, grateful awareness that our access to God as Father is a free gift won by the costly sacrifice of Jesus the True Son, and then enacted in us by the Hole Spirit, who helps us know inwardly that we are His children ... Jesus's name is shorthand for His divine Person and saving work. To come to the Father in Jesus's name, not our own, is to come fully cognizant that we are being heard because of the costly grace in which we stand."
    - Packer: "I pray to the Father through the mediation of the Son and the enabling of the Holy Spirit."
- Fear — Prayer is the Heart Engaged in Awe
    - If you're in awe at God's greatness when you come before Him, you're engaged.
    - "We are hidden in the hollow of God's hand, as it were, in Jesus" (Exodus 33:18-23; John 1:14-18; Colossians 3:1-3). Be amazed at His stooping to the earth to hear us!
    - "'God is here, within these walls; before me, behind me, on my right hand, on my left hand. He who fills immensity had come down to hme here. I am now about to bow at His feet, and speak to Him ... I may pour forth my desires before Him, and not one syllable from my lips shall escape His ear. I may speak to Him as I would to the dearest friend I have on earth.'"
    - We can warm our hearts before beginning prayer by meditating on "some aspect of the theology of prayer."
        - "We are now adopted, loved children going to our Father."
        - "We have a great High Priest and Advocate at the right hand of God, so we can approach the throne in confidence."
        - "We have the Holy Spirit within us, prompting us and helping us to pray."
- Helplessness — Prayer is Accepting Weakness and Dependence
    - We must recognize our dependence on God as we come to Him
        - "This is an outworking of gospel faith, because only the one who confesses complete spiritual bankruptcy can receive Christ's salvation."
        - "It almost seems that the help of the Spirit is triggered by our helplessness."
    - Romans 8:26 tells us that the Spirit intercedes for us; if we feel helpless and don't want to pray, or think that we will be unheard, remember: "you wouldn't even be feeling helpless and needy toward God unless He was at your side making you capable of feeling that way"
<br></br>

### What Prayer Gives
- Perspective—Prayer reorients your view toward God
    - "Prayer brings new perspective because it brings God back into the picture ... addressing God verbally about our needs, fears, hopes, concerns, questions, perplexities, and sins almost immediately forces us to think differently about them."
    - example: Asaph in Psalm 73; when he goes into the sanctuary - "the equivalent of prayer (73:14)" - and his perspective was jolted back to reality.
        - He gives another picture for the reorientation that occurs during prayer - "Like a dream when one awakes" (Psalm 73:20)
- Strength—Prayer as Spiritual Union with God
    - Prayer is the way we realize all the gifts we’ve been given in Christ.
    - “Prayer is the way that truth is worked into your heart to create new instincts, reflexes, and dispositions."
- Spiritual Reality — Prayer seeks a heart sense of the Presence of God
    - “Through prayer our somewhat abstract knowledge of God becomes existentially real to us."
    - Westminster Larger Confession Question 182: 
        - Q: How doth the Spirit help us to pray?” A: We not knowing what to pray for as we ought, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by enabling us to understand both for who, and what, and how prayer is to be made; and by working and quickening in our hearts (although not in all persons, nor at all times, in the same measure) those apprehensions, affections, and graces which are requisite for the right performance of that duty.”
        - “engaged ‘affections’—a heart engaged in fear, wonder, and love—are necessary for the ‘right performance’ of prayer."
        - These affections are not guaranteed by the Spirit at all times; but the ‘duty’ of prayer is still ours to carry out.
    - When the Spirit is pleased to give this heart sense of God’s Presence:
        - “It is a glorious divine manifestation of God unto the soul, shedding abroad God’s love in the hearts; it is a thing better felt than spoken of: it is no audible voice, but it is a ray of glory filling the soul with God, as He is life, light, like and liberty, corresponding to that audible voice, “O man, greatly beloved” (Dan 9:23) … It is that which went out from Christ to Mary, when He but mentioned her name—“Jesus saith unto her, Mary.” … When He uttereth this one word ‘Mary,’ there was some admirable divine conveyance and manifestation made out unto her heart, by which she was so satisfyingly filled, that there was no place for arguing and disputing whether or no that was Christ.” — The Christian’s Great Interest, William Guthrie
<br></br>

### Where Prayer Takes Us
- Self-Knowledge — Prayer requires and creates honesty and self-knowledge
    - Calvin and Augustine taught that prayer cannot begin without humility. This sense of our own spiritual insufficiency must take us “into deep honesty with ourselves."
        - “It is a simple fact that the nearer we get to supreme beauty or intelligence or purity, the more we are aware of our own unsightliness, dullness, and impurity."
        - Knowing God better of necessity brings with it a deeper knowledge of ourselves: our own “inward postures, attitudes, perspectives, and inordinate desires that lead us to sins small and large."
            - Ask Isaiah 6:1-5
    - Calvin’s Institutes begins thus: “Nearly all wisdom we possess, that its to say, true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves."
    - “Edmund Clowney observes that prayer involves an honesty that has no real parallel in human relationships, because every human resolution necessarily involves only a part of your personality."
        - i.e. we relate differently to different people, with whom we have differing relationships. I relate differently to my wife than my coworker, boss, pastor, etc.
    - Edmund Clowney: “In relation to God, however, we are ‘naked and pinned down’ (Hebrews 4:13). Our masks are gone, pretense is useless: the relationship is not partial but total. All that we are stands related to our Maker and Redeemer."
<br></br>

- Trust — Prayer requires and creates Restful Trust and Confident Hope
    - These are Calvin’s third and fourth rules for prayer.
    - “Just as prayer must combine awe and intimacy, it must also combine submission and ‘importunity.’"
        - “The final thought of every prayer must be for the help we need to accept thankfully from God’s hand whatever he sees in His wisdom."
            - i.e., "a deep acceptance of God’s wise will"
        - “On the other hand, we are invited to specifically, intensely, and repeatedly make our needs known in prayer with confidence that they will be heard."
        - remember Calvin’s treatment of the apparent contradiction? These two paradoxical truths must be held in stasis together, lest we stress the former and become passive and adopt a defeated demeanor towards God, or stress the latter and become disgruntled when our prayers aren’t answered in the way we wish
<br></br>

- Surrender — Prayer requires and creates surrender of the whole life in love to God
    - “A commitment to put God first and love and follow Him supremely is necessary before God can grant our prayers without harming us."
    - This is the sense James means to convey in James 1:6-8; the double-minded man does not place God at the forefront of his desires.
    - Remember Augustine’s letter to Anicia: You should not begin to pray for all you want until you realize that in God you have all you need.
<br></br>

Calvin: “It remains for us to seek in Him, and in prayers to ask of Him, what we have learned to be in Him."
