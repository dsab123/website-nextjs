_This post is second in the series on reading books well. You can read the first post <a href="/blog/18/up-your-2021-reading-with-evernote-and-tomatoes">here</a>._

In the last <a href="evernote-and-tomatoes">post in this series</a> we looked at how to add some structure and purpose to our reading. If those three steps form the skeleton of a philosophy of reading, let‚Äôs fill in the flesh and bones. How exactly should you go about _reading_ a book?

Getting through a whole book can be a daunting task for many reasons. You may be afraid that you won't be able to follow the plot, or understand the material. One of my biggest fears when I read is that I won't retain what I learn. Many a time I've finished a book only to realize I didn't know what it was about! Have you?

I now aim to read books in such a way that I can state what the book is about in my own words. If after finishing a book, I can state its main thesis and some important points, then I‚Äôm happy.

But a book is usually a couple hundred pages long. How can you synthesize the a whole book in just a few sentences? 

You break it down.

Structure is your friend in this effort. With structure and a bit of effort you can break the book down into understandable chunks.  Books are made of chapters, so it stands to reason that if you can learn to read one chapter of the book well, you‚Äôre well on your way to understanding the book as a whole.

So, let‚Äôs learn a reading strategy that will empower you to understand what you read, one chapter at a time.

## Reading Rule #1 - Find the Melodic Line 

Let me get metaphysical for a moment. I promise, it‚Äôs relevant. 

Every product of human creation (a tv episode, a musical composition, a book) that is worth consuming has a beginning and ending. And if it's coherent, it has structure. If you start at the beginning, you should expect to be able to follow the development of the product to the end. We can call this Organic Unity. Us humans in the twenty-first century have come to expect Organic Unity from the products we buy. TV shows that aren‚Äôt recorded with an understandable plot line are tanked pretty early on (or maybe they‚Äôre not aired in the right order ‚Äî here‚Äôs missing you, Firefly). But the shows that create a coherent universe, with a discernible plot line, usually fair well. This is the same for any medium we consume, so it applies to podcasts, blogs, and of course books. The key to Organic Unity is what I call the Melodic Line.

What's a Melodic Line? 

What are the implications of knowing the melodic line of a chapter? If you know it, you‚Äôll be able to "hang" what you learn on the melodic line throughout the chapter. It‚Äôll be the skeleton on which your author will hang the meat of the chapter. If you can keep the Line in your head as you read, you‚Äôll be in a good place to structure the lineaments of the author‚Äôs thought. 

So, how can you find this melodic line?

In most cases you‚Äôll be able to spot the melodic line within a few seconds of the beginning of the chapter.

The author will often point out the Line explicitly. You want to skim for a sentence, usually the last one in the first few paragraphs, that‚Äôll look something like "The reason for the resurgence of W can be traced to X, Y and Z", or "Let's look at A for this chapter."  Sometimes they'll come out and say "My thesis for this chapter is X." The more experienced authors will offer this in the most obvious way possible, because they want you to understand not only what they are going to say, but the direction their thoughts will take.

I usually underline the melodic line heavily and write THESIS in the margins to make it easy to find when I skim the chapter later. 

NOTE: Some pieces of literature don‚Äôt have a melodic line. Older commentaries for example are notorious for expositing a passage in a verse-by-verse style, while not including a chapter-level summary of the passage in question. Also, collections of essays on a particular person or topic sometimes have the same issue. In cases like these, the melodic line will actually span the entirety of the volume. Maybe there's an introduction where the melodic line is spelled out. Sometimes, it‚Äôs simply the subtitle of the chapter.

Once you've found your Line, you've found the cornerstone of the book. Now, you can read with an eye to building upon this foundation. To use another analogy, if the Line is the spine, the Outline is the rest of the skeleton.

## Reading Rule #2 - Discern an Outline

Once you‚Äôve nailed down the melodic line of a chapter, then you can focus on the next layer of structure, the Outline. The Outline is simply an exposition of the Line.

If the melodic line is well-written, it‚Äôll contain the broadest form of the outline. So, what you want to do as you read is to look for clues that your author is moving from one point in the melodic line to the next. These clues normally live at the beginning of any given paragraph. Keep in mind that some paragraphs are more useful than others in this respect.

Paragraph style is important too. In this blog, I try to keep my paragraphs short and punchy. And I leave a lot of whitespace between them. 

Whereas in a book, the paragraphs are probably going to be longer, with less space between them.

If the chapter has subheadings, those are going to help you greatly as you discern the outline. You may be able to form an outline consisting of just the melodic line and the subheadings.

If you‚Äôre really pro then you‚Äôll skim ahead at various points, by reading the first sentences of each paragraph _before_ you read the chapter. I‚Äôve found skimming ahead to be especially helpful when I‚Äôve lost sight of the melodic line, when I don‚Äôt know where my author is going.

## Rule of Reading #3 - Annotate like Cray-cray

_If you‚Äôre reading a book that you‚Äôve borrowed, either from a friend or the library, I feel for you._

It‚Äôs important to interact with what you read in a deep way if you want it to remain in your memory. The more you dialog with the book, the more it‚Äôll stick in your brain. So talk to it! Have a conversation with the author as you read. Write in the margins, go crazy. I‚Äôve been known to draw hearts beside sentences I love, the occasional ‚Äòlol‚Äô when something is funny, or 'WRONG' or 'EVIL' beside sentences I abhor. I take it all personally. And when I have a reactionary thought that is worthy of being written down, I stop reading and write it down. Once you‚Äôve finished the chapter, your inked interaction with the author will appear like a battlefield to the untrained eye. But you will only see the remnants of a hard-fought effort to understand and interact with the author.

When I read a chapter that doesn‚Äôt have subheadings, I combine this rule with the previous to create an inline outline.

If you've ever returned to a chapter you've read and found it foreign? I bet you didn't leave your mark on it at all! Make sure to not let that happen. 

## Reading Rule #4 ‚Äî Write A Summary Statement

This step might be the hardest of them all. 

You‚Äôve found the melodic line, formed a rough outline, and finished reading the chapter. Now you must consolidate all your knowledge of the chapter into one sentence.

It can be as long or as short as you want it to be, as long as it captures the outline in broad strokes.

If you want to be lazy, you can just regurgitate the melodic line as your Summary Statement. It‚Äôs better than nothing. But you‚Äôre better off if you can manage to wrangle all the content of the chapter into your own words, because then you're interacting with the chapter as a unit. 

It's best to work at a Summary Statement as soon as you finish reading the chapter. It'll help you when you go back to review the chapter later.

## Reading Rule #4 ‚Äî Review Regularly

I try to review the Summary Statement, if not the whole Outline, a few times to work it into my memory. Three times is enough - the day after, two days after, and one week after you finish writing it. I also try to bring it up in conversation. Speaking the Statement out loud is another vehicle you can use to impress it into your mind. Plus, it makes for more interesting conversations!
