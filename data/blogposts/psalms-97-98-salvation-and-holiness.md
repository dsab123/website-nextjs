I had a really good reading this morning in _Psalms By The Day_, by Alec Motyer, on Psalms 97 and 98. Below is his translation of the two psalms.

Note his divisions and sub-headings, which are quite remarkable. He finds chiasms in many place where they aren't easily seen!

## Psalm 97
### A.1 Reigning God: Rejoicing World
> 1.  _Yahweh is king:_
>>_let the earth exult;_
>>_let the abundance of coastlands rejoice._

### B.1. The world-rule of the Righteous God
(His throne)
> 2. _Clouds and darkness surround Him;_
>>_righteousness and judgement are the basis of His throne._

(His enemies)
> 3. _Before Him, what a fire goes!_
>>_And it consumes His adversaries all round._

(His presence)
> 4. _His lightning illuminates the world of people;_
>>_the world of people sees and writhes._

> 5. _Even mountains melt like wax because of Yahweh's presence -_
>>_because of the presence of the Sovereign of all the earth._

(Cosmic revelation)
> 6. _The heavens have declared His righteousness,_
>>_and all the people will see His glory._

### C.1. The shaming of idolaters; the submission of their gods
> 7. _All those who serve an idol will reap shame —_
>>_who are making their boast in the godlets._
>>_Bow in worship to Him, all you gods!_

<br></br>

### A.2. Revealing God: rejoicing church
> 8. _Zion has heard and rejoiced,_
>>_and the daughters of Judah have exulted_
>>_because of Your judgements, Yahweh,_

### B.2. The supernatural rule of the Most High God
> 9. _because You, Yahweh, are Most High over all the earth._
>>_Exceedingly You are exalted over all gods._

### C.2. The joy of the righteous in a God of salvation
(Moral commitment)
> 10. _O you who love Yahweh, hate evil._

(Guaranteed care and enrichment)
>> _He simply keeps the souls of His beloved;_
>>_from the hand of the wicked He delivers them._

> 11. _Light is sown for the righteous,_
>>_and for the upright in heart rejoicing._

(Joy in a revealed God)
> 12. _Rejoice, you righteous ones in Yahweh,_
>>_and give thanks to the memorial of His holiness._
<br></br>

## Psalm 98
>A Song.

### A. Yahweh the Savior (of all the earth)
(Salvation accomplished)
> 1. _Sing to Yahweh a new song_
>>_because of the wonderful things He has done._
>>_His right hand has achieved salvation for Him,_
>>_and the arm of His holiness._

(Salvation revealed)
> 2. _Yahweh has made known His salvation:_
>>_in the sight of the nations_
>>_He has revealed His righteousness._

(Salvation explained)
> 3. _He has remembered His committed live and His truth_
>>_for the house of Israel._
>>_All the ends of the earth have seen_
>>_the salvation of our God._

### B. Yahweh the King (of all the earth)
> 4. _Shout aloud to Yahweh, all the earth;_
>>_burst forth, and shout out, and make music._
> 5. _Make music to Yahweh with the lute and the voice of melody._
> 6. _With trumpets and the voice of the horn,_
>>_shout aloud before Yahweh, the King._

### C. Yahweh the Judge (of all the earth)
> 7. _Let the sea thunder, and all it contains,_
>>_the peopled-world and those living in it._
> 8. _Rivers - let them clap hands._
>>_Together let mountains too shout out,_
> 9. _before Yahweh_
>>_because He is coming to judge the earth;_
>>_He will judge the world of people with righteousness._
_and peoples with fairness._

Motyer explains the link between salvation (Psalm 97) and holiness/righteousness (Psalm 98):
<br></br>

Salvation from the standpoint of Psalm 97: _“Psalm 97 focuses in on Yahweh’s own and terrible righteousness: it is the foundation of what He is (2), inherent in the very nature of things (6), and drastically dangerous to His enemies (3–4). Salvation must — if it is real salvation — satisfy that righteousness. Psalm 98 says that it does._
<br></br>

And from Psalm 98: _"Salvation itself is a work of holiness (98:1); when Yahweh makes known His salvation, He is revealing His righteousness (2). To such a complete extent does His salvation meet His righteous requirements that ‘salvation’ and ‘righteousness are parallel terms — different words describing the same thing._
<br></br>

_"We can therefore confidently say that the Holy God is satisfied to look on Him (Jesus) and pardon me — satisfied, the very heart of salvation! Look at Hebrews 12:22–24 (NKJV). We are called ‘just’ and ‘made perfect’, and the proof of this is that we live, without fear, in the presence of ‘God the Judge of all’. The supreme Judge Himself is content to have us! **Satisfied!**_
