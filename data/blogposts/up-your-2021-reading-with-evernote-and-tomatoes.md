_This post is first in a series. You can read the next one <a href="/blog/22/how-to-read-one-chapter-of-a-book">here</a>._

Do you want to read more this year? How are you going to do it? 

Will you pick up the first book you find mildly interesting and muscle your way through it? 

Certainly the just-do-it strategy is better than not reading at all, but is prone to failure. The book you pick up may require you read it according to its genre, for example. Otherwise, you might try to read a lengthy classic like you would a breezy novel. The result will involve much back-and-forth darting of the eyes as you try to understand what's happening. I tried to read _A Tale of Two Cities_ in such a manner, and did not realize that one of the pivotal characters had died until six chapters after he was last mentioned. The just-do-it approach leaves you uninformed about the book you're reading, unable to appreciate and understand it.

It also leaves you aimless. What happens after you muscle your way through that book? I guess you'd pick up the next one… and after that? There isn't much of a method here.  It'd be easy to lose steam after the first few books, since you're not progressing toward something concrete.

Your approach to reading should not be an uninformed unstructured wander from one book to another.

A better approach would be to read according to a system. A good system will keep you from an purposeless meander from book to unrelated book, and will also enable you to read more consistently, analyze its arguments and take a stance on whether it is _true_ or not.

I've been feeling my way toward a reading system like this for the last six years, and have recently discovered that such a system is plainly taught in many homes across the country. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Well-Educated-Mind-Classical-Education-Expanded/dp/039308096X" target="_blank">Well-Educated Mind: A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had</a>, Susan Bauer unpacks the reading system that is taught in the Classical Educational homeschool approach. It incorporates what's called the _trivium_ of understanding, which consists of three categories: _grammar_, _logic_ and _rhetoric_. Each stage builds on its predecessor. To complete the grammar stage is to get a bare understanding of what the book is about. The logic stage is accomplished when you've analyzed the author's arguments and can reason his arguments out loud to another person. The rhetoric stage is your response to the book — it's a determination of whether the book on the whole is _true_, as well as a response to the author's logical arguments. To move from stage to stage in your analysis of a book, Bauer recommends reading the book all the way through — that's one time per stage, so you'd be reading the book three times. The approach also involves quite a bit of writing about each book.

As you can see, her system is pretty intense. A classical education is all well and good, and there are certain books you should definitely read more than once, but that's not what we're aiming for in this post, nor <a href="https://www.danielsabbagh.com/blog/4/about">what I'm aiming for with this blog</a>.

We've seen that an unstructured approach will cause you to lose steam; jumping into an over-structured one could intimidate you and deflate your confidence.

What I propose is a middle road between the two. A lightweight approach that establishes just enough structure, so that you're free <a href="https://www.danielsabbagh.com/blog/4/about">to read more, and read better</a>.

<div class="centeredText">— 📚 —</div>

Though not to Bauer's degree, I do keep track of the books I read, and I do write about them. But I don't use a physical notebook to do so. I use <a href="https://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a>. At some point in the future I'll write more about Evernote (it functions as my 'external brain'), but for now I'll say that it is the best note-taking app I've ever used, and perfect for this case. Evernote is available however you use your tech: on a smartphone, in the browser, and on a desktop or laptop.

Let's look at some points in Bauer's reading system and simplify them a bit, tracking our data in Evernote (or notebook) along the way. 

If you're not a tech person, you can use a paper notebook instead — looseleaf would be best, to allow for growth and changes in your tracking.

And if you like food and/or puns, you're in for a treat — we'll use tomatoes to help us implement the meat of the system. I have tomato on the brain because my wife is cooking up some Spanish Rice in the kitchen. Mmmm…

## Suggestion 1 — Learn What Kind of Book You're Reading

So, you've picked up a book you want to read. What now?

Recall my misadventure in _A Tale of Two Cities_. You wouldn't eat salad with a spoon, or soup with a fork; each requires its own method of consumption. Books are no different. Francis Bacon conflates the food and reading analogies with an apt observation: "'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested' (p 18)." A fiction novel is going to require a different kind of attentiveness than a science textbook. The genre of the book will determine how you should engage with it.

In addition to genre, the author's writing style plays a significant role in how the book is to be consumed. Writing styles vary from author to author, with some being easier than others to read and digest. Aristotle is going to be harder to read than modern authors, because his use of language is quite different than what we're used to (not to mention that his work is translated into English from Latin). His language is quite meaty and he uses unfamiliar words. Peter Krump, the author of _Break-Through Rapid Reading_, came up with three principles that'll help you determine the difficulty of the book you have in front of you: 

1. The more abstract words a passage contains, the harder it is to read quickly.
2. The fewer ideas a passage contains, the easier it is to read fast.
3. The more prior knowledge of the subject of a written passage the reader has, the easier it is to read fast.

The principles are given in the context of speed-reading and with passage-level granularity, but with a bit of tweaking we can make them work on the book level. We can combine the first two, as an author who uses abstract words is likely to have a more complex writing style. And we can leave the third rule as it is, since it applies just as easily to a book as to a passage. Thus, we can reformulate the principles as follows:

1. The older a book is, the harder its going to be to read (I find that older books have more complex language than modern ones).
2. The more prior knowledge of the subject of a book the reader has, the easier it is to read fast.

### Track it in Evernote
You can create a note for each book you read, taking some note of its genre and the author's writing style. We don't want to go too crazy with our notes here, we just want to keep track of how we're approaching the book. This will be helpful for starting out, and is a good reference for picking it back up again later.

NOTE: Bauer recommends writing a summary statement of each chapter in the book as you read. This is a great idea! I'll expand on good book note-taking in another post.

Next, we'll see how to link this single note with some others to erect our minimalist reading system.

## Suggestion 2 — Make a List of Related Books

Part II of _Well-Educated Mind_ contains an annotated list of books in the following categories: Novel, Autobiography, History, Drama, and Poetry. The list is ordered chronologically, and Bauer intends you to read through the books in each category from beginning to end. If you started in the History category, you'd read works by ancients like Plato, Aristotle and Augustine while the end of the list would have you reading modern historical works.

Those categories are maybe a little too ambitious, especially since we're not aiming to work through the whole Classical Education curriculum. Each of these categories is almost thirty books long. Rather than read through the historical development of the novel, what if you just want to read a bunch of books by Stephen King? Maybe you want to understand how airplanes work, or are looking for books about tomatoes and how to use them. Rather than following Bauer's outline (unless it intrigues you — if it does, by all means go through her list), make up your own category. If the category's subject matter is new to you, some light googling should return a few books that are worth adding.

Repeat for as many categories as you want to create. For reference, I tend to create 3-4 categories for my reading every year.

Why read according to a category and not according to the uninformed meander we thought about at the beginning of this article? I can see at least two benefits. First, when you read according to a category you're developing a body of knowledge on a particular topic. The more you read, the more well-versed you'll become on the category. This is important for many reasons, but the simplest is because it's important to specialize in something. Far too many of our modern pursuits require a surface-level knowledge, and we have far too many of these modern pursuits. Going deep in a topic gives you an exclusive context into the topic and builds your overall confidence. The second benefit flows from the first. It implements the last of our rules from the previous suggestion, too — the next book you read in the category will be easier to read than prior ones. 

If you can stick with a category for years, you'll find yourself a bonafide master of it, and any book relevant to your category will be easy to fly through.

### Track it in Evernote 
I like to plan out my reading right at the beginning of the year. To do this I create a note titled "Reading List 2021" or similar. Then I create a bulleted list for each category I've thought up, and fill it with links to the notes I created for each book in the prior suggestion.

## Suggestion 3 — Time Yourself with Tomatoes

If your appetite was whetted by the food-filled words at the beginning of this post, you'll be happy to learn that we've reached the promised-for tomatoes, the meat of our minimalist reading system. 

Well, almost.

Before reading anything, it's important to carve out time to read with an undistracted mind. "The first task … is not the reading of Plato, but the finding of twenty minutes (p 22)."  Singular focus is necessary to comprehend and enjoy what you read. It's difficult to find time where you can set aside concerns that pop up in your head like notifications on your smartphone, but if you don't you'll be reading poorly, with one half of your mind on the book and the other occupied with chores.

Setting time aside to read is also more efficient than reading a page here and there throughout the day. Because reading involves context. Context is the 'knowledge', experiential, informational or otherwise that you have to pick up when you perform a task. Some contexts are easy to remember; the context for riding a bike is hard to forget, no matter how long it's been since you've ridden one. Other contexts are more difficult to pick up after putting down. Books are one such context. If you don't put the book's context down rightly (writing summary statements in the chapter like we saw in the first suggestion is great for this), or if you leave it for too long, you won't remember what you learned when you last picked it up. It's best to not have to juggle context when you can avoid it, because remembering what you read last time involves extra mental overhead. Thus, the less context you have to juggle the smoother your reading will go.

Be encouraged to learn that this is not a new problem for our human race; journal entries of women in the 1800's are laden with laments regarding the same struggle: "'dwelling much on the contemplation of little things, [we] are in danger of losing the intellectual appetite' (p 21)."

Let's lose neither our intellectual appetites nor our physical ones: It's time for the tomatoes! 🍅

### Track it with Tomatoes
To create time for myself to read, I use <a href="https://www.tomato-timer.com" target="_blank">this online Pomodoro timer</a>. What's a Pomodoro, you ask? It's Italian for 'tomato', and also a well-known <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/Pomodoro" target="_blank">timeboxing method that manages focused work in twenty-five minute intervals</a>. You simply set the timer and focus on the task at hand until the timer rings. If twenty-five minutes seems too ambitious at first, you can start with five- or ten-minute intervals, and work your way up to the full-time Pomodoro.
