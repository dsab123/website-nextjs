Our men's group at [church](https://www.arcopc.org) is going through Herman Bavinck's [Wonderful Works of God](https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-wonderful-works-of-god-9781733627221?variant=12437042790447). I'm going to blog through the book, developing my own outlines and reflections. The outline will be opinionated and detailed, the reflections sparse.

## Opinionated Outline

### Chapter 2 - _Knowledge of God_
- "God is the highest good of man -- that is the testimony of all the Scriptures." (p.8) 
	- All of Special Revelation bears this out, and at its core is the promise-to-fulfillment movement of Covenant of Grace - "I will be a God unto thee, and ye shall be my people" (p. 8) 
	- Jesus is the fullest expression of God's care for His people.
		- "Christ is God expressed and God given. He is God revealing Himself and God sharing Himself, and therefore He is full of truth and also full of grace." (pp. 8, 9).
- There exists a beautiful dialectic, call-and-response between God and His people in the covenant of grace.
	- "God gives Himself to His people in order that His people should give themselves to Him." (p. 9)
	- The church feels His love for her, and declares her love for Him in response (1 John 4:19)
- The knowledge of God is different than other kinds of knowledge (a la the ones in the prior chapter), which are earthly and are passing away. How?
	1. In its _origin_ - it comes from Christ, not us
		- Christ exclusively determines access to the Father, Matthew 11:27
		- Christ is exclusively qualified to be sent by the Father, Isaiah 42:1, so His word is dependable.
	2. In its _object_ - this is knowledge of _God_, the Eternal One, not knowledge of earthly things
		- Knowledge of creation leads us to know God in "slight, obscured ways, ways that are mingled with error and not even esteemed highly. (p. 11)
	3. In its _essence_ - this knowledge is a real _knowing_, "not mere information" 
		- What's the difference between the two? "Real knowing includes an element of personal concern and involvement and activity of the heart." (p. 13)
		- In this knowledge of course Jesus is the foremost; in His relationship with the Father, "knowledge and love came together." (p. 13).
	4. In its _effect_ - this knowledge imparts eternal life
		- The wisest and the richest have the most knowledge, and that knowledge leads to a better life but still ends in death. 
		- "If knowledge of visible things can enrich life, how much more will the knowledge of God make for life?" (p. 14).

## Sparse Reflections

Bavinck begins this chapter where he leaves off in chapter 1 - only God is the highest good of man, who can solve man's enigma.

In the dialectic relationship of love between God and His people, it is important to emphasize that the declaration of love for God on the part of the church is one that is borne out of _feeling_. "It is an experience that the church has _felt_ because God presented Himself to them for their enjoyment in the Son of His love." (p. 10).

Bavinck believes that the word of God has power. It can effect eternal life!

Bavinck writes very doxologically, and we should think that way about our relationship to the Lord. We could stand to talk about our _personal_ love for God more in our fellowship and gatherings.
