Dr. Addison Alexander, one of the last great Princeton Theologians, was asked for some gospel comfort from a little girl named Lucy, whose father had recently died. Before Dr. Alexander could write to her, however, his own father passed away.

"It was not long after that he composed the beautiful lines
which are given below, and which were labelled on the outside of the envelope that contained them, "Medicine for Lucy", and within - "

### LINES 'TO A FATHERLESS GIRL'.

> _You asked me, Lucy, to express_  
> _My feelings towards the fatherless;_  
> _And I consented to do so;_  
> _But ere I could redeem a word--_   
> _The solemn tidings you had heard--_  
> _I was without a father, too._ 

> _Believe not the calumnious tongue,_  
> _Which says that none except the young_  
> _Are sensible of such distress._  
> _Though many years have o'er me passed,_  
> _And though the next may be the last,_  
> _I feel that I am fatherless._  

> _The breaking of that 'golden bowl'_  
> _Has caused to gush within my soul_  
> _A spring of sympathy with you._  
> _I know, with all my mind and heart,_  
> _What once I only knew in part;_  
> _for I have lost a father too._  

> _Though you are young, and I am old,_  
> _Your feelings warm, and mine too cold,_  
> _I need a comforter no less._  
> _But while I now with you can grieve,_  
> _With you I likewise can believe_  
> _That God will help the fatherless._  

> _And if His care extends to me,_  
> _How strong must his compassions be_  
> _Towards gentler natures in distress._  
> _The mercy that will not neglect_  
> _The strong man, surely will protect_  
> _The child, and that child fatherless._  

> _Woe to the sinner that offends_  
> _The little ones whom God befriends,_  
> _And whom the Savior will confess!_  
> _Woe to the wretch who can deceive,_  
> _Or would intentionally grieve,_  
> _The orphans and the fatherless!_  

> _But no! Thou hast a Father still,_  
> _Who can defend His child, and will_  
> _Her rights maintain, her wrongs redress._  
> _The witness of the Spirit gives_  
> _Assurance that thy Father lives._  
> _Lucy, thou art not fatherless!_  

> _What is this life of cares and tears,_  
> _If He in smiles to thee appears,_  
> _Through Christ's dear passion reconciled?_  
> _Each pang and shock while here we roam,_  
> _Is but a gentle summons home--_  
> _The Father calling for His child._  

> _Sooner or later, on His breast,_  
> _Thou shalt enjoy unbroken rest,_  
> _Beyond the reach of earth's alarms;_  
> _Sooner or later, thou shalt win_  
> _The prize of perfect peace within_  
> _Thy Father's everlasting arms._  

> _Meantime, be cheerful and be bold,_  
> _Dear lamb of the Good Shepherd's fold._  
> _He loves His little ones to bless._  
> _Though all forsake thee, He will not;_  
> _Though desolation be thy lot,_  
> _He will not leave thee fatherless._
