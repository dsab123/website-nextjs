"How do you know the Bible is the word of God?" Have you ever been asked this question? Usually it's asked in a derogatory manner, possibly as a preface to other questions like "Why is Christianity an exclusivist religion?" or "Why isn't the Koran _also_ the word of God?" Sometimes, however, the question is asked out of genuine interest. Maybe you're the one asking the question.

My goal in this post is two-fold:
1. I want to strengthen your faith in the Scriptures as the Word of God, if you're a Christian; and
2. I want to give you some food for thought on what the Bible thinks of its own skeptics.

Let's start by looking at what Christians of the past centuries thought.

-------

You may have heard of the [Westminster Confession of Faith](https://opc.org/confessions.html), whose origins date to 1647. Chapter 1.5 states:

> _"We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture. And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, **our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.**_" (bold mine)

John Calvin, whose writings predate the Confession by about a hundred years, devotes considerable space to the same issue. Chapter 7 of his Institutes of the Christian Religion is titled "Scripture must be confirmed by the witness of the Spirit. Thus may its authority be established as certain." A few excerpts:

> _“If we desire to provide in the best way for our consciences — that they may not be perpetually beset by the instability of doubt or vacillation, and that they may not also boggle at the smallest quibbles — we ought to seek our conviction in a higher place than human reasons, judgments or conjectures, that is, in the secret testimony of the Spirit.” I.7.4_

> _“The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason. For as God alone is a fit witness of Himself in His word, so also the Word will not find acceptance in men’s hearts before it is sealed by the inward testimony of the Spirit. The same Spirit, therefore, who has spoken through the mouths of the prophets must penetrate into our hearts to persuade us that they faithfully proclaimed what had been divinely commanded.” 1.7.4_

> _“Some good folk are annoyed that a clear proof is not ready at hand when the impious, unpunished, murmur against God’s Word. As if the Spirit were not called both ‘seal’ and ‘guarantee’ (2 Corinthians 1:22) for confirming the faith of the godly; because until He illuminates their minds, they ever waver among many doubts!” 1.7.4_

> _“Those whom the Holy Spirit has inwardly taught truly rest upon Scripture … the certainty it deserves within us, it attains by the testimony of the Spirit.” 1.7.5_

> _“[The Scripture] seriously affects us only when it is sealed upon our hearts through the Spirit. Therefore, illumined by His power, we believe neither by our own nor by anyone else’s judgement that Scripture is from God.” 1.7.5_

> “We seek no proofs, no marks of genuineness upon which our judgement may lean; but we subject our judgment and wit to it as a thing far beyond any guesswork! This we do, not as persons accustomed to seize upon some unknown thing, which under closer scrutiny, displeases them, but fully conscious that we hold the unassailable truth!” 1.7.5

> _“We feel that the undoubted power of His divine majesty lives and breathes there. By this power we are drawn and inflamed, knowingly and willingly, to obey Him, yet also more vitally and more effectively than by mere human willing or knowing!” 1.7.5_

> _“God, therefore, very rightly proclaims through Isaiah that the prophets together with the whole people are witness to Him; for they, instructed by prophecies, unhesitatingly held that God had spoken without deceit of ambiguity (Isaiah 43:10). Such, then, is a conviction that requires no reasons; such, a knowledge with which the best reason agrees — in which the mind truly reposes more securely and constantly than in any other reasons; such, finally, a feeling that can be borne only of heavenly revelation.  I speak of nothing other than what each believer experiences within himself — though my words fall far beneath a just explanation of the matter.” 1.7.5_

> _“'The arm of God will not be revealed’ to all (Isaiah 53:1). Whenever, then, the fewness of believers disturbs us, let the converse come to mind, that only those to whom it is given can comprehend the mysteries of God (Matthew 13:11).” 1.7.5_

About two hundred years after Calvin, Archibald Alexander, the founder of Princeton, preached a sermon in the late 1700's titled _Obedience to Christ gives Assurance of the Truth of His Doctrines_. Here are a few of his statements (read the whole sermon [here](/blog/26/obedience-to-christ-gives-assurance)):

> _Many suppose, that plain unlettered Christians, who know little or nothing of history, and are therefore unable to appreciate the force of the external evidence in favour of Christianity, have no rational foundation for their faith; but merely receive the Scriptures, because they have heard, from their parents and teachers, that they are the word of God. That many in christendom have no better foundation for their faith than this, is readily admitted: but the real Christian, whose mind has been enlightened by the Spirit of God, believes the Scriptures to be the word of God on the best and highest evidence, on the testimony of God himself; for when the truth is apprehended in its spiritual nature, by a divine light shining upon it, it manifests itself to be the word of God; because it bears the impress of God on its face._

> _Every true believer has the witness in himself. He needs no external evidence to convince him of the truth of the gospel. As he needs no proof that the sun exists and is the source of light when it shines into his eyes; so when the light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ who is the image of God, shines into his heart, he knows that this spiritual light proceeds from the Sun of righteousness._

Very helpful words from Calvin and Alexander here. 

For both, the answer to the question of the authority of the Scriptures is not given to satisfy the skeptic in apologetic-style takedowns, as has become all-too common in our polarized society. The Answer is the Holy Spirit.

It is possible to convince ourselves or to the unbelieving skeptic, using reason and evidence, that the Bible is the word of God. The Westminster Confession calls these proofs "incomparable excellencies." But on what grounds would resultant assurance stand? It would stand on our reason, or on the evidence that we use to make our case. But what happens when either we discover a flaw in our reasoning, or new evidence shows up which appears to contradict our earlier conviction? We would be like those tossed about by every wind of doctrine, James 1:5. Talk about being "perpetually beset by the instability of doubt or vacillation."

Rather, we should be putting our trust somewhere "more excellent than all reason." Man's reason is always faulty. But if God Himself witnesses to the authenticity of His word to me, I can be content to rest my faith there. And that is exactly what the Spirit of God does for every Christian. “Those whom the Holy Spirit has inwardly taught truly rest upon Scripture … the certainty it deserves within us, it attains by the testimony of the Spirit," says Calvin. There is no need for "proofs or marks of genuineness" on man's part to reason upwards, we have that proof from the Holy Spirit testifying in our hearts. "The Spirit of God bears witness with our heats that we are children of God", children who believe the words of their Father, who hear the voice of the One Shepherd (Romans 8:16, John 10:27-30).

Calvin is wonderfully childlike in his encouragement for us to take the Word of God as it is, sealed by the Spirit. This is nothing less than Paul's commendation to the Thessalonian church: "We also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men by as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers" (1 Thessalonians 2:13). Think of the first Christians, in churches like the one in Thessalonica and Corinth. "For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth" (1 Corinthians 1:26). Consider the totality of believers from then onward to today - mostly poor, "unlettered Christians" as Alexander calls them, "who know little or nothing of history." This conviction by the Spirit they share with the highest of Christian academics, and both for the same reason.

I have two closing thoughts, correspondent to the two angles from which the question of the authority of the Scriptures can be asked.

After having begun strong, are you now are weak in faith? Do you now struggle to continue to believe the that Bible is God's Word? Remember the times of refreshing you've had with the Lord Jesus. Can you leave Him who loved you and gave Himself for you? "He loved you more than His life, for He gave His life to get your love." Consider what a privilege to have believed at all; "the Arm of God is not revealed to all." Jesus's Spirit passed over the powerful and those of noble of birth to illumine your heart.

Perhaps a deconstruction or wolf-in-sheeps-clothing story has begun to gnaw at your faith. There are many of them. 

Remember that when the Spirit called you, He called you into a life of obedience, and that obedience strengthens your faith. There is a vital, symbiotic relationship between faith and obedience. If you're struggling to believe believe the Bible is God's Word, chances are you are struggling with obedience too. The Word of God to the Thessalonians was "at work in [them]." Jesus knows who you are, and you will hear his voice. Commit yourself to obey Him and forsake your sin, and the assurance will come. "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority" (John 7:17). Find an older brother or sister in the faith, and confess your sin struggles to them, if indeed you're struggling. They will help you.

If you are struggling with how to answer a skeptic, or feeling ashamed at the lack of hard proof: 

What's one to do when people make fun of you for believing the Bible? It would be convenient if there was a rock-hard argument at hand for them. There is, and He is the Spirit. But the natural man cannot understand Spiritual things of God, things pertaining to God's Spirit:

> The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
1 Corinthians 2:14-15

Let's resist the urge to formulate a coherent, successful defense of the faith. Let's simply do what Paul did, preach the Gospel<sup>1</sup>: 

> For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
Colossians 1:24

If they laugh, that's okay. Take one for the team, fill up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions (Colossians 1:24). It is by our afflictions that we conquer, and manifest the resurrection life of Christ.

> [Do not be] frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. 
Philippians 1:28
