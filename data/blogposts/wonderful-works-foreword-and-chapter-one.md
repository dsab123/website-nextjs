Our men's group at [church](https://www.arcopc.org) is going through Herman Bavinck's [Wonderful Works of God](https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-wonderful-works-of-god-9781733627221?variant=12437042790447). I'm going to blog through the book, developing my own outlines and reflections. The outline will be opinionated and detailed, the reflections sparse.

## Opinionated Outline

### Foreword
- The Christian Religion, as a unit, an "economy of salvation," is a work of God wrought in history that is still not complete yet.
- The Wonderful Works of God are revealed so that the church would "come to know these works of God, to glory in them, and to thank and praise God for them."
- Modern times have seen a decline in this understanding of the Christian Religion. Why?
	- Life is too busy; modern man has too many responsibilities and obligations that do not afford him time to read "old theological works."
	- Old theological works belong to their own era - the Christian faith is a "work that  began in the dawn of time and continues in this era."
- We need the truths of the Wonderful Works of God to be retold again in _this_ era, according to _this_ form, while of course not sacrificing the _essence_.
- The audience is the interested layperson, and the young men and women who find themselves "acquainted with the frequent challenges that the Christian religion is exposed to at the present time."

### Chapter 1 - _Man's Highest Good_
- "God, and God alone, is man's highest good." p. 1
- Man is unique and distinguished from the animals; though he is an earthly creature, he has a longing for spiritual, absolute things.
	- Sin has not completely lost the glorious attributes contained in that image.
	- "these [attributes] are enough not merely to constitute him guilty but also to testify of his former grandeur and to remind him continually of his Divine calling and heavenly destiny." p. 2
	- "He is a sensuous, earthly, limited and moral being, and yet he is is attracted to the eternal and is destined for it." p. 3
	- This is by God's design, as we see these truths taught in Scripture (Proverbs 4:22, Ecclesiastes 3:11)
- Not only are sensuous pleasures and earthly treasures earthly - Science, Knowledge, Art, Culture, the True Good and Beautiful, living for others, service are earthly and are passing away also.
	- Science, Philosophy and Knowledge - "Any science, philosophy, or knowledge which supposes that it can stand on its own pretensions, and can leave God out of its assumptions, becomes its own opposite, and disillusions everyone who builds his expectations on it." Why?
		1. These things require discipline and "can become the portion of only a select few", never "satisfying the general deep needs which were planted in human nature at creation, and which are therefore present in everybody." p. 4
		2. Amid the ebb and flow of these disciplines, they always begin to "flow" with "extraordinary and exaggerated expectation, always failing to achieve its own predictions in a short period of time.
		3. All of these pursuits would still leave man unsatisfied - "if I have not love, I am nothing" (1 Corinthians 13:2).
	- Art suffers from the same problem - it "cannot close the gulf between the ideal and the real." p. 5
	- The 'human' disciplines - service, culture, civilization also - "we are embarrassed to answer the question whether we are moving forwards or backwards" as a world society.
		- If these disciplines are not rooted in the law of God, they lose their "force and character." p. 6
		- Question for reflection - where have we seen this ideal of progress go awry when not rooted in the law of God?
			- [Here's one example. Ouch.](https://twitter.com/FreeBlckThought/status/1560309212063748096)
- Conclusion - "Man is an enigma whose solution can be found only in God", p. 7
	- This enigma consists of man seeking to satisfy his spiritual, eternal desires in a never-ending pursuit of earthly endeavors.
	- "Science cannot explain this contradiction in man. It reckons only with his greatness and not with his misery, or only with his misery and not with his greatness. It exalts him too high, or it depresses him too far, for science does not know of both, and they shed their light over man and mankind; and the contradictions are reconciled, the mists are cleared, and the hidden things are revealed." p. 7

## Sparse Reflections

### Foreword
_Summary Statement_ - For Christianity to endure, the church must receive a fresh sight of the Wonderful Works of God, written for this era.

The end goal of this work is that men would praise God, and proclaim His Wonderful Works anew, in this generation. This finds expression in Psalm 145:4 - "One generation shall commend Your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts." 

Bavinck sees the Christian Religion as a historical fact, and as a living, vibrant organism that persists through eternity. It _continues_ in this era as it did in the eras before, and as such must find expression in the forms and context of _this_ era. He doesn't give us the option of romanticizing the "good old days " to the point of giving up the fight of maintaining a 'current' Christianity.

He is clearly alarmed at the threats that Christianity was facing at the time of his writing. He writes with a compassionate heart towards those young people who are encountering fierce opposition to their faith.

### Chapter 1
_Summary Statement_ - Without the knowledge of God (which is covered in Chapter II), man finds himself trapped, yea traps himself, amid the earthly in his pursuit of the good, true, beautiful (and eternal!).

The pursuits of men are viewed more charitably here than I am used to viewing them. It is refreshing to admit that man indeed does a lot of good in this world, though it does not leave him satisfied. 

Man tries to achieve so much in the 'higher pursuits', especially in the years since the Enlightenment. Though much wisdom and 'progress' is gained by them, they disillusion their adherents for the three reasons Bavinck gives. He takes the trio of Science, Philosophy and Knowledge and demonstrates this explicitly.

How do Bavinck's arguments stack up against postmodernism ("what's true for you is true for you, what's true for me is true for me")?
- Postmodernism would not prevail, for man "requires a good which does not become good because of circumstances, but which is good in and through and for itself, and unchanging, spiritual, eternal good." p. 2

It is an interesting exercise to compare Calvin's Insitutes with Bavinck's (although to be fair this is not his Systematic Theology):
- "Each of us must, then, be so stung by the consciousness of his own unhappiness as to attain at least some knowledge of God." Calvin, Book I.I
- "Every person, therefore, on coming to the knowledge of himself, is not only urged to seek God, but is also led as by the hand to find Him." Book I.I
	- Bavinck doesn't say this yet; he probably will in the next chapter.
