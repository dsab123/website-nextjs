I had some time this morning to meditate on James 3, using [a template I've developed over the years](/blog/1/outline-for-bible-study). Here are my notes on James 3:1-12, following that template. I hope they are helpful to you.

### _The Tongue, an Untamable Fiery Evil_

#### Outline
	- vv 1-2 - Stumbling Tongue
	- vv 3-5 -  Small and Powerful Tongue
	- vv 6-8 - Fiery and Poisonous Tongue
	- vv 9-12 - Double-Minded Tongue
#### Observations
	- James narrows his focus from teaching to stumbling to stumbling in what one says.
		- to "stumble" is to fall unintentionally.
		- This hearkens back to James' command to be "slow to speak". If you watch where you're walking, you won't stumble. So if you think before you speak, you won't speak haphazardly.
	- The examples of horse and ship 
		- both are reactive; if you control the mouth and the rudder, you have the whole object
		- But, verse 7, the tongue cannot be controlled, or tamed.
	- The tongue "boasting of great things" reminds me of the world powers in Daniel 7 who are symbolized as mouths that speak great things. 
	- The tongue is:
		- a fire,
		- set on fire,
		- stains the whole body,
		- sets on fire the entire course of life,
		- set on fire by hell,
		- a world of unrighteousness,
		- a restless evil,
		- full of deadly poison
	- We are mixed temples, producing both blessing and cursing from the same tongue.
	- Jesus is the originator of James' example in 3:12, Luke 6:43-45
		- The tongue is a restless evil because the heart is a restless evil.
		- This parable along with James brings us to realize the truth that whatever we say is a direct reflection of our hearts.
#### Interpretation/Application 
	- _Identifying Jesus as our Great High Priest and Prophet_
		- How does this text relate to the priestly service of Jesus, to His supremely worthy sacrifice of Himself, to His present priestly intercession for His people, and to His Spirit’s relentless labor to purify believers and build us into the new, living temple? 
			- We are mixed temples, producing both blessing and cursing from the same tongue. Jesus never spoke a word out of season; all His words were in season (Isaiah 50:4); He did not hide the words from our Father which we needed (Psalm 40:9-11). The Gospel itself consists of words, and He spoke them to us, giving us eternal life, John 10:27-28.
			- In His passion, He did not speak to justify Himself.
	- _What does this teach me about:_
		- _God and His character?_
			- God truly must be very forgiving for the sins we commit with our mouths, for they are many!
		- _Human nature, character, and behavior?_
			- The tongue should be handled like a serpent. We should be slow to speak, that we might handle our words carefully.
		- _Christ and His salvation?_
			- Jesus showed us how to use our tongues - to glorify God and to encourage and build up the saints. The gospel is the means of encouragement to the saints, and simultaneously the tool of cursing for the wicked. The love of the Gospel of the Kingdom motivated Jesus in His harsh words to the Pharisees, for example.
		- _The church, or life in the people of God?_
			- As redeemed children of God, we have the power to control our tongues. We should be known in the world as those whose words are gracious, seasoned with salt (Galatians 4:6).
	- _Application questions_
		- _If I believed and held to this, how would that change things?_
			- If I were able to tame my tongue, my words of counsel to others would be received in a welcome manner, rather than with "shields up."
		- _When I forget this, how does that affect me and all my relationships?_
			- "When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent," Proverbs 10:19. When I do not bridle my tongue, I sin more. My family has to hear all my words, which are often too many. Better to speak less at home than too much.
	- _Paraphrase the section in one sentence or phrase_
		- The tongue is a dangerous, fast-firing and restless organ, likened to that of a serpent's. Christians who tame their tongue do not regret their words, and are singularly-minded to please God and their neighbor, like the Lord Jesus.

#### _Prayer_ :

My Savior, help me to tame my tongue. You know the words I've spoken, every one. My words have often damaged relationships, some of which remain unhealed. May I be like my Savior, whose words give life and healing rather than death and burning. You see right through my words down to my heart. May my heart be pure and undivided before You, so that my tongue and my words might follow. Make my words a source of encouragement and teaching to my brothers and sisters in my church. Let me speak a word in season to those who are suffering, like You did for us. Keep me from evil words. I thank You that though I am a sinner, this command is not impossible for me, for Your Spirit has renewed my heart and with that renewal comes the power to obey Your word and grow in likeness to You. Forgive me for the evil words I've spoken. Amen.
