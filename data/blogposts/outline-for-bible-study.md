In the last seven years I've read many books on how to study the Bible.

I've compiled much of what I've learned from these books, what has worked well for me, into this outline. When I want to dive deep into a book of the Bible, I copy this template, and begin working my way through the questions. I don't answer all of them every time, my goal is to feel my heart rise up in affection toward the Lord. Then I transition to prayer. More on that process in another post.
<br></br>

This outline is heavily influenced by <a href="https://amzn.to/2QLitRO" target="_blank">Prayer</a> by Tim Keller and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Dnh6Wq" target="_blank">Walking with Jesus Through His Word</a> by Dennis Johnson.

Hope its helpful!

Identifying and understanding how "Scripture speaks of God’s role as the Lord of the covenant, and how Jesus the God-man fulfills these roles” (Walking With Jesus Through His Word)
<br></br>

    - The Lord as __Commander__, directing the thoughts, words, and deeds of His servants  
    - The Lord as __Judge__ of His servants and His enemies

<br></br>

Jesus as the Final Prophet
- Is there a prophet of God in this text, a spokesman who brings — or should bring — God’s truth to God’s people?
- Is the prophet faithful to his mission of revelation, or unfaithful, or a mixture of faithfulness and unfaithfulness?
- How does his faithfulness preview Jesus? How does his failure reveal the need for Jesus, the final Word, to come?
- Are the prophet’s words reinforced by miraculous signs?
- Do those signs correspond to signs performed by Jesus, the final Word? 
- Does this prophetic word press God’s lawsuit against guilty people and predict coming judgement?
- How do such words accuse us, too, and so turn us to Jesus, who bore our judgement?
- Does this prophetic word promise God’s Mercy and relief in the face of present suffering? 
- How is Jesus the full and final ‘yes’ to all of God’s prophetic promises of salvation?
- Since the NT apostles are extensions of Jesus’s prophetic ministry, how do their words and miraculous signs point us back to Jesus, who commissioned them to speak His Word to His church?
<br></br>

Jesus our Great High Priest
- How does this text relate to the priestly service of Jesus, to His supremely worthy sacrifice of Himself, to His present priestly intercession for His people, and to His Spirit’s relentless labor to purify believers and build us into the new, living temple? 
- How does the wide spectrum of Scripture’s priestly passages that touch on themes such as sanctuary, separation, sacrifice, and supplication unveil Jesus’s multifaceted ministry as our Great High Priest:
    - to cleanse our consciences and free us from the threat of eternal death by offering up Himself as our once-for-all, atonement-achieving Substitute and Sacrifice?
    - to qualify us to draw near to God in adoring worship and confident prayer?
    - to make us His new and living sanctuary, where our corporate unity and purity display His glory?
    - to consecrate us to His service even in the nitty-gritty of daily life, where we eat and drink and do all things as holy servants to exhibit God’s glory and reflect His love toward others (1 Corinthians 10:31, 8:13)?
<br></br>

Jesus the King of Kings
- Wherever in Scripture we glimpse battles or skirmishes in the war between God’s king and kingdom, on the one hand, and Satan’s domain of darkness on the other, we are catching sight of landmarks that point the way to Christ, our Warrior-King.
- Wherever in the Bible we see justice administered and hear words of wisdom, we are encountering landmarks that direct us to Jesus the Judge of all, in whom all the treasures of God’s wisdom reside.
