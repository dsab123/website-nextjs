Did you know that the Bible speaks at length about gardens?

It both begins and ends in a garden, and in almost every book in between the first and the last develop and grow this garden theme.

Well, a few days ago I came across one of those passages in the Bible, Isaiah 27:1-6. I noticed the garden language and turned to Calvin to help me tease it out.

So let’s look at the passage together, gleaning from Calvin’s insights along the way.

_In that day the LORD with His hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea._

_In that day,_

_“A pleasant vineyard, sing of it!_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; I, the LORD, am its keeper;_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; every moment I water it._

_&nbsp; &nbsp; Lest anyone punish it,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; I keep it night and day;_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no wrath._

_Would that I had briars and thorns to battle!_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; I would march against them,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; I would burn them up together._

_Or let them lay hold of my protection,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; let them make peace with me,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; let them make peace with me.”_

_In days to come Jacob shall take root,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; and fill the whole world with fruit._


## _From Small Serpent to Full-grown Leviathan_
Immediately we are confronted with the phrase "In that day", which we also encounter in the next section of our passage. This phrase is a favorite of the Old Testament writers, and particularly Isaiah, who uses it some forty times to describe the end of the world, with all that it entails. 

Take Isaiah 17:7 for example, an unmistakable reference to the final judgement:
> _“In that day man will look to His Maker, and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel.”_

The judgement of God, the rescue of His people, the destruction of evil forces are all in view with this phrase. What a momentous occasion! And during this event we have this Leviathan serpent. Calvin takes the reference to the strong, sinewy serpent to be an allegorical reference to Satan and his kingdom. In the Garden of Eden, of course, Satan is present as a fledgling serpent. By the time of the final judgement, we can see that his kingdom has grown to the point where he is likened to a terrible dragon-Leviathan-beast.

We should be encouraged, says he, that the Lord describes Satan’s power in these terms — because we’ve all experienced his strength. Strength to divide churches, strength to cause pain, strength to take life. How comforting to know that the Lord knows that Satan’s power is indeed a mighty force against the saints. “Wonderful are the stratagems with which he comes prepared for doing mischief, and dreadful the cruelty which he exercises against the children of God.” A similar comfort can be found in the intro to Jesus’s letter to the church in Pergamum:

_“I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.”_ 
Revelation 2:13

Jesus Himself here acknowledges that the church lived in the same streets where Satan, in his kingdom and his strength, made his dwelling place. What a relief that the Lord knows our condition in this life, with its chronic assailment by the strong, sinewy forces that so easily entangle and rage against us. ❤️

## _The LORD Draws the Sword_
If Satan is a mighty, twisting dragon of the sea, then it befits the Lord to have "a hard and great and strong sword" with which to slay him. Calvin does not point this out, but here again we see another symbol from the Garden of Eden pop up — a strong and terrible sword! In Genesis 3, the sword was placed in the hand of the Cherubim as an agent of God to guard the sanctity of the garden: 

_... at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life._
Genesis 3:24
 
In our passage, on this last day, God Himself takes up the sword and vanquishes our foe.

## _Fructifying Forces_
On the same day that Leviathan is destroyed, the Lord turns to his pleasant vineyard and sings to it. We ourselves, the church, are the vineyard. For us to be restored, Satan and his kingdom must be destroyed. Calvin remarks, “The object of all the vengeance which God takes on His enemies is to show that He takes care of the Church.” And once the Lord does that, He turns to us in enjoyment and delights in our fruits with His song. We will “yield fruit plentifully, and this will furnish abundant materials for singing.” Zephaniah teaches us that the Lord does indeed sing for joy at us:

_“The LORD your God is in your midst,_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; a Mighty One who will save;_

_He will rejoice over you with gladness;_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; He will quiet you by His love;_

_He will rejoice over you with loud singing.”_
Zephaniah 3:17


And not only is God the joyful recipient of the fruit, He is the one who tends the garden that produces it. Calvin mentions the “two instances of His diligence, that He will ‘water it every moment’, and will defend it against robbers, wanton cattle and other threats. These are the two things chiefly required in preserving a vineyard, cultivation and protection.” And “though the vine may suffer many attacks, and though enemies and wild beasts may assail it with great violence, God declares that He will interpose to preserve it unhurt and free from all danger.” There is no wrath in Him towards His precious vineyard — “if we know that God has called us, we may justly conclude that He is not angry with us, and that, having embraced us with a firm and enduring regard, it is impossible that He shall ever deprive us of it.”

If we recall the Garden of Eden imagery, we’ll remember that tending the garden was a task that fell to Adam. The gospel and the incarnation shine brightly here, if we remember the Christ-Adam dichotomy: _where Adam failed, Christ succeeded._ Adam failed to tend the garden of God, broke covenant with Him, failed to slay the serpent, so Christ comes as a man to purify the garden from its thistles, earn back favor with God, slay the dragon.

The end result of this dragon-slaying, garden-tending work of God-in-Christ is that His church, the seemingly-dead, almost cut-off root of Jacob, will in coming days blossom and bud and cover the whole earth, as the Garden of Eden should have. This work was begun “at the coming of Christ, who collected and multiplied the people of God by the gospel.”

How wonderfully encouraging to see the zeal with which our Heavenly Gardener keeps and tends His garden, which we are!
