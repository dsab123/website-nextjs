## Total Book Count: 16

Well, I simply did not read as many books in 2022 as I have in prior years. This is a _reading_ blog, so I should explain myself a bit.

My explanation is that I bought a house with my wife, and we welcomed our first child in February.

Here's a list of all the books I read, with a little about the ones I chose to write about.

### _The Temple and the Church's Mission:  A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God_ by Greg Beale
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Temple-Churchs-Mission-Biblical-Theology/dp/0830826181" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/temple-and-the-churchs-mission.png" className="smallPostImage" alt="Temple and the Church's mission Book" title="" /></a></div>

I [wrote a review of this book here](/summary/10/temple-and-the-churchs-mission). This volume harmonizes the Old and New Testaments by demonstrating that the purpose of the temple does not terminate at the conclusion of the Old (and in fact has roots in the first chapters of Genesis), but persists all the way through the New, and ultimately finds its terminus in the New Heavens and New Earth.

### _In the Fullness of Time:  An Introduction to the Biblical Theology of Acts and Paul_ by Dr. Richard B. Gafin
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fullness-Time-Introduction-Biblical-Theology/dp/1433563347/" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/fullness-of-time.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="In the Fulless of Time Book" title="" /></a></div>

Biblical Theology loomed large in my reading this year if it's not obvious by the subtitles of this and the last book.

Part I of this book can be summarized as a redemptive-historical reclamation of Pentecost. Foundational to a proper view of the event is its non-repeatability, dovetailed with it being an act of the Lord Jesus upon the early church. As it was with the Lord at His Jordan Baptism, so it was with the Church at Pentecost. Those who have received the Holy Spirit have taken part in Christ's end-time judgement, for all are baptized with either the Holy Spirit or Fire (Luke 3:16-18). John the Baptist compares his ministry to Jesus's, and likens both to a baptism; Jesus does as well (Luke 12:50).

Part II can be summarized as a Summary of Paul's Theology, fronted by logistical considerations concerning how we should approach his thought, amid the last few hundred years' unhelpful hermeneutical approaches. The second portion of Part II, the 'content proper', examine's Paul's understanding of the commonly-held Jewish two-age eschatological formulation, and how  Christ's work causes an 'overlap' of the ages. The rest of Part II is devoted to discussions on Resurrection and the Christian Life. Jesus and the Spirit are so unified in their work that Paul declares that Christ "became" the life-giving Spirit, 1 Corinthians 15:51. The book ends on a triumphal tone, teaching us that our sufferings, which "fill up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions" (Colossians 1:24), are not to be viewed soteriologically but in a missiological, evangelistic manner. It is through suffering, not in spite of it or in addition to it, that the Church conquers; in all our afflictions we are more than conquerors.

### A Lifting Up for the Downcast by William Bridge
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifting-Up-Downcast-Vintage-Puritan/dp/1941129080" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/lifting-up-for-the-downcast.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="A Lifting Up of the Downcast Book" title="" /></a></div>

William Bridge, a puritan, preaches thirteen sermons on Psalm 42:11 - "Why are you downcast, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise Him, my salvation and my God." 

His thesis throughout the volume is that saints have no scriptural (that is, justifiable from Scripture) reasons to be discouraged, whether the discouragement arises from weak grace, temptation, affliction or perceived uselessness. In the last sermon he explains how active faith in Christ finds a way through any discouragement.

### _The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms_ by Nicholas Nassim Taleb

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bed-Procrustes-Philosophical-Practical-Aphorisms/dp/1400069971" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/the-bed-of-procrustes.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="The Bed of Procrustes Book" title="" /></a></div>

What a fun book of Aphorisms. I've written about another of Taleb's books [a few years ago](/blog/16/top-5-books-of-2020#antifragile).

_Aphorisms_, or witty one-liner proverbs, are what ninety-nine percent of twitter users think they are putting out with their tweets; these here are modern aphorisms indeed. As I casually flipped through the book's pages I used them as weird conversation-starters with my wife. Taleb is a genius who is not afraid to publicly call out those he deems imbeciles. Included in this categorization are Ben Bernanke, Sarah Palin and others. I should write some more about this one.

Some punchy examples:
- "You never win an argument until they attack your person."
- "The opposite of manliness isn't cowardice; it's technology."
- "My best example of the domain dependence of our minds, from my recent visit to Paris: at lunch in a French restaurant, my friends ate the salmon and threw away the skin; at dinner, the very samy friends ate the skin and threw away the salmon."
  - This is why Combinatory Play is so important for innovation, [as Ozan Varol describes Einstein's work](/summaries/5/think-like-a-rocket-scientist).

### _The Complete Stories_ by Flannery O'Connor


<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Stories-FSG-Classics/dp/0374515360" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/oconnor-short-stories.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="O'Connor Short Stories Book" title="" /></a></div>

This volume is fantastic. O'Connor is being cancelled nowadays, of course. Her writing is so complex and deep that I had to read the Cliffs Notes after each story to get the deeper meaning behind it. Each character in every story is purposefully named. O'Connor highlights the second-class place of the elderly in the fast-changing times of the 1930's in the South. And the character's relationship to nature says a lot about whether they're on the "right" or "wrong" side by the end of the story.

And here are the rest, nicely grouped into History and Fiction.


### History
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remember-Alamo-American-History-Bite-Sized/dp/1782435107" target="_blank">American History in Bite-Sized Chunks</a> by Alison Rattle and Allison Vale - I realized I hadn't done any reading on American history since high school. This was a quick refresher on important dates and people.<br/>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Milestone-Moments-Philosophical-Landmarks/dp/0857625047" target="_blank">Philosophy in 50 Milestone Moments</a> - Like the above book, I needed some knowledge of basic terms and concepts. Nice pictures in this one.<br/>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nine-Day-Queen-England-Lady/dp/0852346131" target="_blank">The Nine-Day Queen</a> by Faith Cook - A biography of Lady Jane Grey, who was puppeted to the top of the British throne during the Tudor period. Written from a Reformational vantage, much care is taken to highlight young Jane's faith and maturation in the midst of the political turmoil that surrounded her. The story of her martyrdom is particularly moving.<br/>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geerhardus-Vos-Theologian-Confessional-Presbyterian/dp/0998748722" target="_blank">_Geerhardus Vos: Reformed Biblical Theologian, Confessional Presbyterian_</a> by Danny Olinger - Vos has opened up for me the Bible's own way of interpreting itself. Olinger's bio will be a treat for any student of Biblical Theology and American Presbyterianism.<br/>

### Fiction

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Speaker-Dead-Ender-Book-Publisher/dp/B004V3PMEG" target="_blank">Speaker for the Dead</a> by Orson Scott Card - Merely read this because I read Ender's Game last year. Some of the dialogue was tortuous, I ain't gonna lie.<br/>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trilogy-Perelandra-Hideous-Strength-Paperback/dp/B00ZAT776G" target="_blank">The Space Trilogy by C.S. Lewis</a> - Wow, I had great fun reading this trilogy. This probably deserves a full blog post at some point. Part of me wonders whether Lewis's intention was to throw every Sci-Fi and Magical character or concept he could think of into the series. It works well!<br/>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Country-Old-Men-Vintage-International-ebook/dp/B000WJSB4Q" target="_blank">No Country for Old Men</a> by Cormac Macarthy - A culture-conscious postmodern lament on how in Bob Dylan's words, "The Times, They Are A'Changin." The ending leaves you with a hollow chest.<br/>
