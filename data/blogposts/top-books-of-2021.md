Here's my reading roundup for this year. And here's a link to [last year's](../../blog/16/top-5-books-of-2020).

### Theology - _All That Is In God: Evangelical Theology and the Challenge of Classical Christian Theism_ by James Dolezal

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-That-God-Evangelical-Challenge/dp/1601785542" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/all-that-is-in-god.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="All That Is In God book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: I read this book because I wanted to understand ths historic Christian understanding of God's impassability - does He have emotions in the same way we do? Does He _feel_ our pain?

Classical Christian Theism, the historical understanding of God as unchanging and simple in His being, has been subjected to recent reinterpretations (modifications? degradations?) by Reformed theologians in the past few hundred years. They teach that the conception of God as unchanging (immutable) prevents us from properly understanding how exactly it is that God relates to humans. On the surface, the charge seems valid - an unchanging God can seem cold and unfeeling. If they have not done away with this doctrine entirely, they have introduced changeable properties into God that are not part of His essence in order to understand the Biblical data relating to God's covenantal relationship with man. However, as Dolezal argues, the classical conception of God as Simple, Infinite and Eternal needs no modernization. Rather than shore up this doctrine, these modifications serve to do the opposite, weakening our understanding of God toward either a tritheism or modalism. Heavy accusations indeed! Dolezal builds his case progressively through the historical witness to the doctrines of simplicity, infinity, and immutability.

### Practical - _Struck Down But Not Destroyed: Living Faithfully with Anxiety_ by Pierce Taylor Hibbs

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Struck-Down-but-Not-Destroyed-ebook/dp/B083V3VCJN" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/struck-down.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Struck Down But Not Forsaken book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: I've read Hibbs natural-theology devotional [Finding God In the Ordinary](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Ordinary-Pierce-Taylor-Hibbs/dp/1532657684) and loved it.

What a beautiful lifting-up of the soul this book is. Hibbs reminds us that our God is the God who speaks, who has spoken His Word to come and befriend us in our anxiety. Anxiety, according to Hibbs (and the Bible, I might add) is not gifted to us so that we might rid ourselves from it, as if we could gift it back to God. Rather than try to coach you _through_ your anxiety, he gives practical advice on how to faithfully live _with_ anxiety. God gives it to us so that He might use it in our lives to do more abundantly than we could ask or even think. He crushes us in order to to call us, He frees us from living life like we're herded in, He trains our spiritual fingers for battle, He shows His love for us by rescuing us from trouble, and gives us in large measure now what He promises to us in fullness. 

Hibbs helpfully lines the pages with his own experiences of living with anxiety. The book on the whole is bigger on theology than experience, because to understand your anxiety, you must understand yourself, and to understand yourself, you must understand God, who made you and in whom you live and move and have your being. Hibbs teaches us that as God's creatures, made in His image, we long for communion with Him and with others. Anxiety cuts at both of these directions, threatening to isolate us and make our lives hell. But in the end, "after the long and harrowing battle with anxiety in this life, after every arrow has been fired and every sword put back in its sheath, there are two things that await us: communion and peace." (317).

### Self-Development - _Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_ by Greg McKeown

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1641164186&sr=1-1" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/essentialism.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Essentialism book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: One of my professors recommended this book to help his students think about the few important things in life, and how to do them well.

Wow, what an breezy and practical read! Greg McKeown educates you on what makes the Essentialist different than the Nonessentialist in this helpful volume. The book divides into four parts - _Essence_, _Explore_, _Eliminate_, and _Execute_. These are the components of what make up am Essentialist, who only does the necessary one or two things, lives in the moment, and lives a life that matters. The Essentialist thinks hard about what their calling in life is, uncommits from unworthy projects to reclaim time, and sets boundaries in order to act on their calling:
* Essence — You have the power of choice, you can discern the vital few from the trivial many, and you know you have to make trade-offs, you can't get everything done
* Explore — You make yourself unavailable to get time to think about the bigger picture; you play to unleash your inner child (because play fosters great innovation); you protect your most valuable asset, sleep; you are very selective about what you choose to do - if it's not a resounding yes, then it's a no for me, dawg
* Eliminate — You learn to cut down on the number of decisions to make by early and graceful No’s; You cut out drossful activities that waste time; you are quick to put up boundaries to make time to edit and whittle down the work you commit to do.
* Execute — You buffer your time by adding 50% to every estimate; you become a force multiplier for others; you commit to routine to get into Flow, and you _Do the Next Thing_ when feeling pulled in a million directions.

### Society & Culture - _Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World_ by Tara Isabella Burton

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Rites-Religions-Godless-World/dp/1541762533/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=strange+rites&qid=1641164259&s=books&sprefix=strange+rites%2Cstripbooks%2C85&sr=1-1" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/strange-rites.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Strange Rites book" title=""/></a></div>

**Why**: A group of brothers from church read this book together over a few months.

Though she's not a Christian, Burton's work is effectively a secular exposition of Romans 6:16: “Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?” In _Strange Rites_, she convincingly argues that every person is religious, even those who don’t affiliate with an institutional religion like Christianity or Buddhism. She describes the different cross-sections of the American populace that comprise the new “Remixed” religious, and proves their religiosity by examining their practices. These practices cover a large swath. The growing Wicca population and New Age philosophies of the “spiritual but not religious” are included in her analysis. But on a more subtle level, she uncovers the newer commonplace spirituality that calls out to us at every avenue and street corner. This spirituality accompanies almost everything the average Westerner does or buys - from the messages that TV shows present to you, to the messages that your clothes themselves preach. The North Face brand is a symbol of wealth and outdoorsmanship. The woman who idolizes her Starbucks to an unhealthy degree equates her alertness and ability to work well with the energy boost that it gives her. Caffeine is a primary factor in the human body’s ability to be more alert, and North Faces are good things - however, what sneaks in along with the item is the spiritual ‘wellness’ that it mediates. Of most help and concern to me was her diagnosis of the Social Justice Religion. This religion is complete with an anthropology (which reduces people to their ethnicity), possess communal rituals (the public canceling of heretical people and collective re-writing of history), even offers an economy of salvation (if you’re white, you can make lifelong penance for yourself and your ancestors). I came away with a new awareness of these things. We must seek to daily renew our minds and re-center ourselves in God’s Story. The only inherently consistent, beautiful narrative to find yourself in is the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the narrative it brings you into. You can refresh yourself in this narrative every time you read the Bible with an eye towards faith in Christ as the Savior of your soul, confess sin with your brothers and sisters, and worship the Lord with them.

### Fun: _Walden_ by Henry David Thoreau

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walden-Illustrated-Henry-David-Thoreau/dp/B09FCCDFFD/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=walden&qid=1641164377&s=books&sprefix=walden%2Cstripbooks%2C129&sr=1-14" target="_blank"><img src="/blogpost/walden.jpg" className="smallPostImage" alt="Walden book" title="" /></a></div>

**Why**: My wife and I were on vacation in Rodanthe, NC and I needed an off-the-wall book to read.

What a profound and eloquent idiot Thoreau was! Dissatisfied with city life in Concord, Massachusetts, Thoreau takes to the woods beside Walden Pond and builds a home and lifestyle for himself there. _Walden_ is his journal-recollection of those two years. Many of his reflections are worthwhile and his thoughts are deep. He laments the rat-race mentality that was gaining ground in the heart of every man as a consequence of the industrial revolution. When a man takes on a mortgage, farm or other maintenance work, "he labors under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before." He advocates instead for a skin-in-the-game paradigm - the students at Princeton should build their own dormitories rather than outsource that knowledge to others! Unfortunately, along with his wise remarks on the tragedies of over-specialization, Thoreau records for us his foolishness. Most striking is his rejection of wisdom from the older generations: "I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it." _Hey Thoreau, Ecclesiastes much?_ Aside from the silly portions, Thoreau's writing on nature, specifically his words on the Pond itself, are a joy to read. Here is a man, made in God's image, delighting in His world. If ever a man could come to the knowledge of the truth through nature, Thoreau would have been that man. A beautiful, but broken picture.

### Notable Mentions

### Theology

<br></br>

#### _[Images of the Spirit](https://www.amazon.com/Images-Spirit-Meredith-G-Kline/dp/1579102050/ref=sr_1_1?crid=19VJ8XEK5R64G&keywords=images+of+the+spirit&qid=1641164486&s=books&sprefix=images+of+the+spirit%2Cstripbooks%2C64&sr=1-1)_ - Kline's depth of insight into Old Testament Biblical Theology is astounding! This work is a sweeping survey of the Image of God. The visions of the Son of Man in the glory-cloud of the Holy Spirit in Ezekiel tell us something of the Son of Man's involvement in creation. Wading through the deep waters in this book was a fun project.

<br></br>

#### _[Isaiah By The Day](https://www.amazon.com/Isaiah-Daily-Readings-Alec-Motyer/dp/1845506545/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=isaiah+by+the+day&qid=1641164467&s=books&sprefix=isaiah+by+the+day%2Cstripbooks%2C130&sr=1-1)_ - A 71-day new translation-devotional through the most glorious of the old testament books, by a British scholar and student of the Bible; the translation illumines the text with insights commonly glossed over in the modern translations, and the devotionals are equal parts convicting, edifying and Christ-exalting.

<br></br>

#### _[Calvin's Commentary on Jonah](https://www.amazon.com/Calvins-Commentaries-Jonah-Micah-Nahum-ebook/dp/B009D01L8S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RKDG2MNLEELV&keywords=john+Calvin+commentary+jonah&qid=1641164523&s=books&sprefix=john+calvin+commentary+jonah%2Cstripbooks%2C81&sr=1-1)_ - Calvin's prayers at the end of each lecture are beautiful and humbling. Jonah, we see, is crabby at God's grace to "them" (Sailors and Ninevites), while taking for granted God's grace to "him". Calvin gets it wrong a few times and turns the tone of the oracle into a discussion of his God can relent from a predetermined judgement, however.

<br></br>

#### _[Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers](https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Lowly-Christ-Sinners-Sufferers/dp/1433566133/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2UQO38NM0IONS&keywords=gentle+and+lowly&qid=1641164585&s=books&sprefix=gentle+and+lowly%2Cstripbooks%2C74&sr=1-1)_ - With help from the Puritans, Ortlund shows us what Christ feels for His people, for He is "gentle and lowly in heart."

### History & Culture

<br></br>

#### _[Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-and-Steel-audiobook/dp/B004JLTPTI/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3G33CR2M99DVO&keywords=guns+germs+and+steel&qid=1641166338&s=books&sprefix=guns+germs+and+steel%2Cstripbooks%2C140&sr=1-1)_ - a grand sweeping survey of the hows and whys of industrial and technological development across the globe. Chapter Three, for example, hypothesizes about why the Incan Ruler Atahualpa and his millions were conquered by a few hundred Spanish conquistadors - it wasn't a result of intellect disparities, but of germs.

<br></br>

#### _[The American Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/American-Civil-War-Winston-CHURCHILL/dp/B0000CKYPT/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2V73QWPM9R0RA&keywords=american+civil+war+churchill&qid=1641166361&s=books&sprefix=american+civil+war+churchill%2Cstripbooks%2C72&sr=1-3)_ - Who would have thought Churchill wrote of the Civil War? Here's a concise unbiased review of the War's major battles from a strategic and political perspective.

<br></br>

#### _[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight](https://www.amazon.com/Gawain-Green-Knight-Verse-Translation/dp/0393334155/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2J52I619KRY1T&keywords=sir+gawain+and+the+green+knight+book&qid=1641166399&s=books&sprefix=sir+gawain+and+the+green+knight+book%2Cstripbooks%2C68&sr=1-1)_ - The amusing alliteration in this poem - each line consists of four "hard" consonants, the first three beginning with the same letter. Very relaxing to follow the pattern!
