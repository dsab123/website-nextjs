### _Fullness of Joy: A Biblical Theology of God with Us_ by Daniel Ragusa

</div>

A great read. Bite-sized chapters walk through the Emmanuel Principle, God dwelling with His people, as illustrated and developed in the Scriptures over time. Even in the Garden of Eden, God's communion with man was not complete. For example, God came and went in the garden; there were times when He was not there (Genesis 3:8). We learn as we walk through this little book that God always planned to dwell with His people permanently and without the stain of sin incurred after the fall. This is of course realized explicitly in the person of Jesus, whose name is 'God with us.' 

The controlling thought in the book is taken from Psalm 16:11 - _"In Your presence there is fullness of joy; at Your right hand there are pleasures forevermore."_ 

This is a great introduction to Biblical Theology. The references to Scripture are myriad, which is a comfort to Reformed Theology newcomers who may be wary that Biblical Theology posits a meta-narrative foreign to the Bible itself. There are also regular references to seminal Biblical Theologies by Kline, Vos and Gaffin, and are indexes for more in-depth study.


### _Wisdom Christology: How Jesus Becomes God's Wisdom for Us_ by Daniel Ebert

</div>

I have some gripes with this volume, but I learned to love the Lord and His wisdom more by reading this one. Each chapter takes a classic passage on wisdom and explains it in light of Jesus being the Supreme revelation of God's wisdom.


The thought that Jesus reveals God's Wisdom to us, and that that wisdom is a "heavenly humble" wisdom that finds its zenith in the cross is astonishing. If we believe that God is Simple, i.e. not composed of parts, then God _is_ His Wisdom. The Scriptures teach this idea in 1 John 4:8, for example: "God is love." Jesus's revelation of God's wisdom reveals that wisdom as one that humbles itself for the sake of others, even sacrifice at the cost of redemption. How astounding is the Wisdom of our God!

### _The Shepherd Leader At Home_ by Timothy Witmer

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-shepherd-leader-at-home-timothy-witmer-9781433530074" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/shepherd-leader-at-home.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A basic primer on leading your family. Witmer applies the four categories from [his prior book on Shepherding in the church](/blog/43/shepherd-leader-chapters-3-and-4) to the family - knowing, leading, providing and protecting together form a comprehensive set of responsibilities for leaders in the home.

### _Faithful and Fruitful: Essays for Elders and Deacons_, edited by William Boekestein and Steven Swets 
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/faithful-and-fruitful-essays-for-elders-and-deacons-9781935369257" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/faithful-and-fruitful.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

Very helpful and informative. I loved the chapters on Catechesis and Clerking. I'll be returning to these two for sure.

### _How to Lead Your Family: A Guide for Men Wanting to Be More_ by Joel Beeke

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/how-to-lead-your-family-a-guide-for-men-wanting-to-be-more-9798886862027" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/how-to-lead-your-family.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A condensed version of _Parenting by God's Promises_, Beeke applies the classic offices of Prophet, Priest and King to the Head of Household. The short volume is full of gospel encouragement, and sketches and practical commands. After reading this booklet I could _immediately_ put some of his suggestions to practice. Christ gave everything for His bride, so I should do the same for mine. The author tells me how. 

The love of Christ for His bride is the backbone of this book.

Here are the quotes I bookmarked:
- "Exercising patience and cultivating the skill of careful listening is part of showing self-sacrificial love to your wife. She should feel emotionally safe and secure in your home and in your heart." p 31
- "Pray for your wife in her presence; let her feel your love, strength and boldness at the throne of grace. Let her feel that you carry her on your heart like the high priest carried the names of the tribes of Israel on his heart." p 40 ❤️
- "If you stop conversing about one another's spiritual life -- the most intimate part of your lives -- then you will cease knowing each other deeply, and your marriage will decay." 48
- "Remember that the Son of God loved His bride eternally; when the Father presented this bride to Him, there was love at first sight for the Son of God. As Mark Chanski writes, 'For His Bride, He left heaven's glory. For His Bride, He was willing to wiggle in Bethlehem's manger and work in Nazareth's workshop. For His Bride, He was numbered with the transgressors in His baptism. For His Bride, He endured near starvation and Satanic temptation in the wilderness. For His Bride, He absorbed years of public ministry abuse by a wicked and adulterous generation. For His Bride, He had no place to lay His head. For His Bride, He marched fearlessly toward the Jerusalem slaughterhouse. For His Bride, He broke the bread in the upper room. For His Bride, He was drenched in blood-like sweat. For His Bride, He said, 'Not my will, but Thine be done.' For His Bride, He handed Himself over to a kangaroo court. For His Bride, He was again and again spat upon and struck in the head. For His Bride, He stood bare-backed at a pillar -- absorbing scourge after scourge. For His Bride, He was mocked while holding a reed scepter. For His Bride, He carried and collapsed under the crossbeam. For His Bride, He was stripped naked. For His Bride, He accepted the spikes into His hands and feet. For His Bride, He was lifted up between heaven and earth as an accursed spectacle. For His Bride, He hung His head before wagging scoffers. For His Bride, He gasped for breath and cried out 'My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?' For His Bride, He finished it and died." 51 ❤️❤️❤️ 
- "Be a gentle warrior for your children. This will help them know that you have taken a clear stand on certain questions. They can then stand up to peer pressure by leaning on you. Do not weaken and try to be a passive, popular dad. That will force your children to stand alone against a wicked generation. Your children will love and respect you far more if you use your kingly authority to defend them from evil, but even if they do not, your exercising of kingly authority still brings glory to Christ." 56
- "if you discipline children only when they push you to your emotional limits, then you are training them in revenge instead of righteousness." 59
- "As for your parenting, you may feel like a father who was once discouraged because things were not going well with his children. He did not know what to do. A friend saw what was happening, and said, 'Remember that the essence of parenting is to make disciples, and the One with all authority in heaven and on earth said, 'I am with you.'" 66

<a id="a-little-theology-of-exercise"></a>

### _A Little Theology of Exercise: Enjoying Christ in Body and Soul_ by David Mathis

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/a-little-theology-of-exercise-enjoying-christ-in-body-and-soul-9781433598678" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/a-little-theology-of-exercise.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

This book helps us tether how we view exercise to how the New Testament views the body. In an age where we are encouraged to be sedentary, to have technology do the work of moving for us, Mathis shows us the Bible assumes an _always-moving_ Christian. His starting point is 1 Timothy 4. Paul teaches us that all bodily blessings, like sex and food, are to be enjoyed and "made holy by the Word of God and prayer" (1 Timothy 4:5). Contrary to the "anti-body" disposition of the false teachers Timothy must contend with (16), Paul exhorts us to receive this bodily benefits gladly. It is in light of this exhortation that Paul says that "bodily training is of some value," 1 Timothy 4:8. 

In the pattern of 1 Timothy 4:5, then, Part I of the book discovers what the word of God is for our bodies, i.e. what God's word says about our bodies, and "practically how we might respond in prayer to what God tells us about our bodies" (17). Part II expands on Christian incentives for regular exercise, devoting a chapter to each - it glorifies God, builds and conditions the brain, strengthens the will to engage in hard things, serves our joy in Christ for the rest of the day, and facilitates our ability to perform good works for our neighbors. Each of these chapters is short and helpful. Mathis makes abundant use of Scripture in each, and in the spirit (Spirit?) of Paul, easily demonstrates how almost all of our efforts at imaging God involve physical movement. It must be this way, because Jesus used His body for the glory of God and the accomplishment of our salvation.

### _Tim Keller on the Christian Life_ by Matt Smethurst

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/tim-keller-on-the-christian-life-the-transforming-power-of-the-gospel-9781433596193" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/tim-keller-on-the-christian-life.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>


A beautiful distillation of the main emphases of Keller's ministry touching the life of the Christian. His exegesis of Luke 15, which I first read in The Prodigal God, hit me like a freight train. It is far more spiritually dangerous to be an elder brother than a prodigal son.

### _King of Kings: A Reformed Guide to Christian Government_ by James Baird

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://press.founders.org/shop/king-of-kings/" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/king-of-kings.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

This little book is a simple explanation of the historic Reformed and Protestant view of Government, and follows a simple syllogism:

1. Government must promote the public good, and
2. Christianity is a public good; therefore,
3. Government must promote Christianity

Baird draws heavily on [Westminster Confession Chapter 23](https://www.apuritansmind.com/westminster-standards/chapter-23/) and the Scripture passages that inform it.

I would have liked a fuller treatment, but this is a helpful start to the complex topic of Christianity and Government.

<a id="short-stories-checkhov"></a>

### _Short Stories_ by Anton Checkhov

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Best-Short-Stories-Paperback-9788184958546/571202529?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/short-stories-checkhov.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>


Checkov is a master of the short story. A few of the entries in this volume were closer to novella size than short story. He writes about the poor in Russia at the turn of the twentieth century, and their interactions with the rich. Both boys and girls, young men and young women, old men and old women. I'd subtitle the volume _Ecclesiastes in a Cup_. The rich and the poor in his stories are capable of both wisdom and foolishness, courage and fear.

[_The Black Monk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Monk) is the most haunting of the stories, in my estimation.

### _Woe to the Scribes and Pharisees: A Jon Mote Mystery_ by Daniel Taylor

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/woe-to-the-scribes-and-pharisees-a-jon-mote-mystery_daniel-taylor/26132326/" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/woe-to-the-scribes-and-pharisees.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

Wonderful read. Initially turned off by the inner monologue of the main character, but I grew to love it and the twist at the end was magnificent.

Based on the endorsements on the back of the book I (perhaps unfairly) speculate that the author has third way sympathies, of the kind that frames the fundamental in a bad light. Maybe I'm wrong though.

<a id="the-phoenix-project"></a>

### _The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win_ by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-phoenix-project-a-novel-about-it-devops-and-helping-your-business-win_gene-kim_kevin-behr/442559/?resultid=c91e9d66-a196-4ab7-93cf-fb8cb2575190#edition=8550120&idiq=7487723" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/the-phoenix-project.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

What a whirlwind read, finished over the course of two days. Very suspenseful. Enjoyed thoroughly. I never thought I'd be up until the wee hours reading a book about software - and I _like_ software. The narrative format for this epic is perfect, and I learned much more in the ol' subconscious than I would have from a textbook format.

If I'm diligent I'll read the authors' non-narrative books on modern software.

My biggest takeaway was to learn to identify the Bretts in our team's workflow, and democratize the knowledge pigeonholed in that one person.

Another is to have a single process for a thing. If you do paper tickets, don't allow digital tickets, else you'll have two sources of tickets which makes for a bad time.

Last one is to remove impediments for adopting new paradigms on the team. If it's not easy, then your new workflow/tech/recommendation won't be followed.

### _Of Mice and Men_ by John Steinbeck

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/of-mice-and-men_john-steinbeck/247566/?resultid=5be7da42-5fd3-4b99-b662-5eb421cb3801#edition=2344706&idiq=2525137" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/of-mice-and-men.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A sad story. I think I'll get into Steinbeck more soon, his writing depicts the struggle of the common people in the lower sharecropper class in California in the 20's and 30's. Enjoyed the introduction which construed the novel as containing characteristics of a play.

### _Leaf by Niggle_ by J. R. R. Tolkien

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/leaf-by-niggle/36377739/?resultid=ec72ea66-5e30-4f5d-b8c1-5268cc9d3438#isbn=0008205531&edition=21547247" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/leaf-by-niggle-j-r-r-tolkien.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>


While reading this short story, I realized I've avoided a lot of Tolkien to my harm and shame. _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ I have read multiple times, and the nostalgia, sorrow and otherworldly-ness I would feel upon completing them was almost too much to bear. Leaf by Niggle evokes the same feelings in my soul. I am stunned, I don't know what to say or write about it.

I immediately identify with Niggle, I long to be focused and bring my projects to completion. The books reminds me of the gospel hope that in the new world all will be made well.

### _The Pearl_ by John Steinbeck


<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-pearl_john-steinbeck/250208/?resultid=a846ed7f-5690-441d-a78b-e5872e3e1f1b#isbn=014017737X" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/the-pearl.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I couldn't stay away from Steinbeck. And I regretted it.

Well, not really. But he tugs at my heartstrings so hard. Kino's obsession with the pearl appears healthy at first, but there is too much evil and greed in the world to let him satisfy his obsession for the good of his child.

I'm sure I learned a lot from this little novel. I definitely _feel_ a lot more.

### _Infidel: My Life_ by Ayaan Hirsi Ali

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/infidel-by-ayaan-hirsi-ali/246754/?resultid=06cbd190-c460-499a-bb27-823574a60df9#edition=4462341&idiq=1275660" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/infidel.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I found this at a thrift store shortly after learning that Ayaan Hirsi Ali had converted from Athiesm to Christianity.

Ali writes beautifully about her childhood in Somalia, her struggles to conform with then spurn Islam, and her emigration to Holland.

I read this as written by my sister in Christ, oftentimes pausing to thank the Lord that He delivered her from the evils of Islam into the light of Christ.

### _Dominion: How the Christian Revoluion Remade the World_ by Tom Holland

<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/dominion-how-the-christian-revolution-remade-the-world_tom-holland/20246548/?resultid=c4ad24f9-a968-4448-9103-2e5e57dee28a#edition=40933664&idiq=44195334" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/dominion-tom-holland.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

What presuppositional logic is in a conversation, _Dominion_ is in a survey of history. There is great power in showing someone that they have no rational ground to defend their beliefs about God or culture. Holland helps us see this. Christianity is inescapable, it is in the air you breathe. 

'Self-evident' truths like those in the Declaration of Idependence, namelt that all men are created equal, is anything _but_ self-evident. Before Christianity, society was heavily stratified, Roman males being on top and possessing the freedom to do whatever they wished. Only Christianity's principle of the Cross, that the last will be first and the first last, could overcome the way things were.

The happy result is that Christianity has given us a stable footing for a prosperous society, even among those who are opposed to it. And those opposed had better take a second look at what Christianity has brought to them, as opposed to, say Islam.

### _Shepherding A Child's Heart_ by Ted Tripp

I am thankful for the Tripp family. _Shepherding A Child's Heart_ is a parenting classic among parents who seem to have raised godly children, in my experience.

The whole book is worth rereading multiplt times. I found his treatment of communication with your child to be most helpful. God has given parents both speaking and the rod for communcating with our child. To spurn either would be to spurn God's gifts to parents to raise their children rightly.
