We are going through officer training at church. Our first book to work through as candidates is The Shepherd Leader by Timothy Witmer. I'm leading the session this Sunday, so I've written out my thoughts on our topic of discussion, chapters 3 and 4 of [The Shepherd Leader](https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-shepherd-leader-timothy-witmer-9781596381315).

## Chapter 3 - Lost and Found: Where did All the Shepherds Go?

### Summary

This chapter is a historical survey detailing the "found and lost and found again" journey of shepherding in the church. Up to the middle of second century, "elders were ordained in every town", as Paul prescribed, but later on, largely due to the influence of Cyprian, the office of teaching shepherd was invested with increasing authority. The office of ruling elder was pushed out and faded into near extinction. The Lord brought a revival of group shepherding along with the Reformation, and afterward continued to develop a proper understanding of the office in the Reformed churches.

### Quotes

- "though elected by the members of the church ... yet [the ruling elder] is not to be considered as deriving his authority to rule from them, any more than he who 'labors in the word and doctrine' derives his authority to preach and administer other ordinances from the people ..." p 70
- "The history of the church reveals a perpetual struggle over not only who leads the church but what leaders are supposed to do." p 72
- "The recognition of the authority of the ruling elder for the well-being of the flock of Christ was virtually lost from the third century to the sixteenth century." p 72
- "Throughout its history, when a clear biblical understanding of the importance of the office of elder and its shepherding functions has been absent or impaired, God's flock has suffered. On the other hand, when leaders have sought to care for the flock, it has prospered." p 72-73

### Observations

- Can't wait to read the BOC on ruling elders!
	- It is very edifying. Learned a lot about primary, secondary and tertiary standards: The Bible, the Westminster Standards and the BCO.
	- => email excerpts of this to the brothers in the leadership training email thread
- Witmer teases out for us the early-medieval church with its Reformed counter-descendants, who rediscovered and developed the idea of the Ruling Elder. We almost always compare the two, especially the former's Romish state, in doctrine. We often don't do with respect to office and rule. See quote from pp 72-73. 
	- => How much more importance would we place on proper church government if we attributed the purity and growth of the protestant church at least partly to the (re-)development of the office of ruling elder?
- Fascinating that the Cyprian's errors in hermeneutics of not treating 'presbuteros' and 'episkopos' in the New Testament interchangeably (which we take for granted today in the OPC), and a return to the levitical priesthood led to the Roman church's hierarchical structure
- => I want to resolve to never put our pastor in the position Chalmers was in before bringing the elders into his work - visiting 11,000 - 12,000 parishioners every two years, with scarcely the time to pray with each.
- Miller's letter to "Christian Brethren" is beautiful: "Your elders will sometimes be called - God grant that it may seldom occur! - but they will sometimes be called to the painful exercise of discipline. Be not offended with them for the performance of this duty." p 71

### Questions

- What should we do with this historical survey of the office of ruling elder? What are some of your takeaways?
	- Surely being grateful is a good start, grateful to the Lord for bringing the church (particularly our churches) back to a biblical understanding of the office, albeit in a circuitous route
	- We can see many other churches around us that have not inherited the blessing of a robust doctrine of ruling elder, and be thankful
		- We have not only inherited the battle-tested doctrines that we are familiar with, but also the doctrine of the ruling elder
- Have we seen any instance where the office of elder:
	- is not appreciated or even implemented?
		- My parents' church - elders are deacons
	- in danger of being eclipsed by a hierarchical structure, with a pastor/bishop over the elders?
- Do the non-reformed Protestant churches have elders? (intentionally broad to incite discussion)
	- Some Baptist churches have seen the light and added a plurality of elders

## Chapter 4 - The Shepherd's Biblical Right to Lead: A Few Words about Authority

### Summary

The loss of respect for authority in our society, rooted in a loss of respect for God's authority revealed in Scripture, has led to a rampant "right-in-my-own-eyes" individualism. This degeneration has affected the church, causing both members and shepherds to be unwilling to "embrace the standards of the Chief Shepherd and His word." Witmer gives an 'Authority Primer' that makes the case that biblical shepherds have the "right to act on behalf of the Good Shepherd" (p 88).

### Quotes

- "It is rational to attack the police; nay, it is glorious." p 76, quoted in Chesterton
	- how prophetic from Chesterton!
- "the popularly accessible and vibrant belief systems and world views of our society are largely excluded from the public arena in which deecisions are made about how the society should be ordered." p 77, quoted in Neuhaus
- "The loss of respect for authority has led to the loss of authoritative standards. The loss of authoritative standards has left each person to be his own standard-maker." p 79
- The Authority Primer
	1. All human authority is derived
	2. The exercise of authority is designed to serve the well-being of those under its care.
		- Paul's "we seek not yours, but you" posture in 2 Corinthians surely melted the hearts of the genuine believers who were struggling to accept his apostolic authority!
	3. This authority is to be directed by God's Word.
	4. All who hold derived authority are ultimately accountable to the One who gave that authority.
	5. The flock is called to submit to the authority of the elders.
		- seems harsh to modern (postmodern?) ears, but a gentle loving admonition to "be not offended" with them would probably soften this perceived harshness

### Observations

- Respect for authority is a cultural necessity, it has been a pillar of Western civilization. This is of course required in the Christian community for proper flourishing.
- I think we're witnessing the implosion of Western society because of this bucking against authority.
- The two extremes of abuse of authority at the end of the chapter are quite chilling, because the motivations were good in both cases. The former by "the need for a greater focus on commitment, discipleship and discipline among the surging members of the 'Jesus Movement" (p 94), the latter by a desire "for the church to resemble the kingdom of God" (pp 96, 97).
	- What is the antidote to being swayed in either direction?

### Questions

- This book was published in 2010; what further cultural developments have we seen since then, particularly in the younger generation of which we have very few in our churches?
	- i.e. submission to authority caused rampant individualism; what has happened since then?
- Discussion Question 2 - "What evidence do you see of the deterioration of respect for authority in the church?" p 99
	- I know of several instances where people have left a church when they are about to come under discipline
- Discussion Question 3 - "Why is a proper understanding of authority important in the context of shepherding the flock?" p 99
	- or, "How can the loss of respect for authority make shepherding harder?"
	- this proper understanding buttresses a member's commitment to the fifth membership vow!
- Discussion Question 4 - "Do you think that people of your church have a clear understanding of the biblical principles outlined in the 'Authority Primer'? p 100
	- I think so, but I wonder whether that is because our demographic is largely non-millenial and Gen Z
- What are some actions the Christian individual, family and church can take to restore a proper view of Christian authority, both within and without the Church?
	- one of each - 
		- individual - confession of sin; 
		- Family - authoritative parenting;
		- Church - church discipline; barring someone from the table puts the congregation in proper fear of the elders' authority
- The fifth membership vow: Do you promise to participate faithfully in this churchâ€™s worship and service, to submit in the Lord to its government, and to heed its discipline, even in case you should be found delinquent in doctrine or life?
	- What do you think about the weight of this vow in light of our culture's hostility to authority?
	- Not enough to critique only the culture; we should critique ourselves too, because we certainly are not free of the influence
- Thinking about the Authority primer, have any shepherds here had to bluntly demand the submission of a sheep who was sinning?
