Recently I had an exchange with a friend on Universalism, the belief that everyone goes to heaven, eventually or otherwise. In advance of our in-person discussion, he sent me a list of verses that seem to make the case for it. Below is my response to him.

I hope you find it helpful.

Hey _______, thanks for your thoughts! 

Here’s an outline of my response:
1. Foundational ‘Givens’ — _The Bible’s Univocal voice, Organic unity, and Literature_
2. Does ‘All’ really mean ‘All’ — _Context is King_
3. Universalism undermines Jesus’s Exclusivist Teaching


## Foundational Givens

Before we get into a discussion about particular verses, I think it might be helpful to lay down some of the ‘givens’ I think and reason from. I think that most Christians would agree with them.

The first given is the Bible’s Univocal Voice. What Jesus states in the Gospels in in the early 30's AD, Paul does not contradict in the 70’s. This is a necessary implication if we believe that the Bible is God’s inspired Word. If it came from God, then it must be perfect as He is perfect. Paul says that the Law, summarized in the Ten Commandments, is “holy, righteous, and good” (Romans 7:12) because God Himself is Holy, Righteous, and Good. Practically, for our discussion, this means that the Bible doesn’t contradict itself. Jesus states that the “Scripture cannot be broken” (John 10:35). This principle will come in handy when we reason about apparently conflicting passages.

The second is the Bible’s Organic Unity. This given follows from both the former one, as well as the fact that the books that make up our Bibles were written over time. An example: We consider the Gospel as a primarily New-Testament concept, yet Paul says in Galatians 3:8 that the Gospel was preached to Abraham, who lives hundreds of years before the New Testamental period. This must mean the Gospel was present in the Old Testament days. Paul says: “And the Scriptures … preached the Gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’” That gospel sounds very different than what Jesus and His apostles preached hundreds of years later. But if the Bible speaks univocally, it must be the same Gospel that Jesus preached. Geerhardus Vos, one of the great Princeton theologians, concieved of that gospel to Abraham as the gospel in seed-form. He  likened God's unfolding revelation in the Scriptures to a plant — it is first a seed in the early part of the Scriptures, growing and blossoming until it reaches full flower in the New Testament. Whether in seed or in bloom, it is the same plant. Augustine, the early church theologian, taught that the New Testament is in the Old concealed, while the Old is in the New revealed. For our purposes, this means that the New Testament is more developed (and consequently clearer) than the Old Testament, though not substantially or essentially different.

The last given is that we can read and understand the Bible as literature. This principle follows from the prior one. Although Christians believe that the Bible is God’s inspired word, we don’t believe that it was handed to us directly from heaven, but was given to us by the Holy Spirit who "carried men along" to write God's revelation. Of course, this all occurred in the medium of time. B.B. Warfield, another of the Princeton Theologians, says: “The Scriptures, while being truly human, are at the same time truly superhuman.” If the first two givens deal with the supernatural aspects of God’s Word,  this one deals with the human. As a compilation of books by different authors, we can expect that there are different genres. Among them are narrative, discourse, prophecy, lament, poetry, and apocalyptic literature. A couple examples are warranted: Revelation is apocalyptic; it is not wise to interpret apocalyptic literature in a literal manner, or else you’ll have to believe that a literal red dragon will come walking out of the sea. As another example, consider Jesus's use of hyperbole. When he spoke of the proverbial man with a log in his eye, he was not  referring to a literal log, but was rather using the extreme language to convey a point. 

And if we recognize that there are different genres in the Scriptures, we must interpret a passage according to the genre of the author. 

But there’s another necessary implication of this point. Only in Proverbs do we see one-line wisdom statements; as far as I’m aware there aren’t any other places where this kind of stand-alone writing is employed. This means that when we’re dealing with any passage of Scripture, not only the genre, but the immediate context is necessary for a proper understanding. This will come in handy as we look at some of the verses you sent me.

Okay, with those principles in hand, let’s look at some of those verses.

## Does ‘All’ really mean ‘All’? Context is King

Many of the verses you sent either mention the words “all” or “world”, which on its own connotes a completeness (however eventual or not) to salvation. However, I’m convinced that if we zoom out a bit to the wider context we’ll find that the opposite is actually the case. In the surrounding verses of each passage, there is always some qualifier on the word with the universal tone. And if we consider our second given, that the Bible is an organic unit, other passages from Scripture should only build our case for or against universalism or any other doctrine. Here are a few examples:

Romans 8:28–39 — 
You have verse 32 in your spreadsheet: “He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?” On its own, this verse seems to imply universal salvation. The first ‘all’ here is referring to human beings. But Paul did not intend this verse to be read on its own; it’s in a paragraph. If we zoom out to the wider context, we’ll see the point that Paul is actually making. In this case, we only have to zoom out to the word prior to all. Before 'all' we find 'us'. Paul is qualifying 'all' with 'us'. God gave his Son for all of us. Us has to be exclusive in some sense, else Paul wouldn’t have used it as a qualifier.
Backing up a bit, we can see that in verse 28 of the chapter that Paul’s concern is to explain to us that God’s purpose is good particularly for those who love God, “those who are called according to His purpose.” Verse 29 describes this chain of actions that God performs for those who are so called. He foreknows, predestinates, calls, justifies, and glorifies them. Foreknowledge and Predestination happen before the person is even born, and glorification refers to their perfected lives and bodies in heaven. It is this specific group of people that Paul has in view when he uses the 'us all’ in verse 32. The glorification of the Christian is so sure to happen that Paul lists it in the past tense here!
That particular ‘us’ extends all the way down to the end of the chapter. Explicit references to this ‘us’ are made in verse 34, 35, 37 and 39. Paul’s purpose here is to encourage Christians in Rome who feared being separated from God’s love by their life-threatening circumstances, i.e. tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword. Those who would bring these circumstances upon the Christians would be other human beings. Paul encourages their hearts by saying that even in these afflictions, which saints of old experienced, Christians will not be separated from their God. Their security in the love of God is so sure that absolutely nothing can separate them from it.
So on the surface, verse 32 might look like it points to all people being saved, but when we examine the context we find that God’s salvation, here consisting of his giving His own Son, is for a particular group of people, namely those who have been foreknown, predestined, called, justified, and (soon to be) glorified Christians.

You have a few other verses from Romans on your list. I think the above explanation can serve to qualify the scope of universal words in those statements, since Paul would not have contradicted himself within just a few chapters of this argument. But let’s consider Romans 5:18 since it parallels 1 Corinthians 15:22, which is also in your list. The scope of “all men” in 5:18 is qualified in the prior verse. Those who receive the free gift of righteousness will reign in life, Paul says. It is ‘all' of these men that are affected by the one act of righteousness, namely the righteous life of Jesus. This section of Romans, spanning from 5:12-5:21, posits an Adam-Christ dichotomy. All who proceed from Adam ('in Adam’ to use Paul's terminology) die, and all who proceed from Christ (‘in Christ’) are made alive. But not all that are in Adam are in Christ. What Adam gives to his progeny is death, but what Christ gives to his progeny are life and grace and justification. And the two sets are not co-equal or co-extensive. He uses this Adam-Christ paradigm again in 1 Corinthians 15:22: “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.” The ‘all’ here is explained in the next verse — it is “those who belong to Christ.” Paul’s concern is for those who are Christ, not those who are in Adam. Notice that he says nothing about those who are outside of Christ in either the Romans or 1 Corinthians passages.

We could look at other passages, which I hope to do when we meet in person, but I hope that this exploration into Paul’s theology will suffice for now. Of the other passages that we could discuss, the occurrence of universal language in 1 Timothy is perhaps the most interesting. But Paul, being the author of that epistle as well as Romans and 1 Corinthians, probably wouldn’t have contradicted himself in his letter to Timothy.

## Universalism Undermines Jesus’s Exclusivist Teaching

Next, I want to point you to the heavy exclusivist thrust in Jesus’s teaching in the gospels. He makes a sharp distinction between those who believe in him and those who don’t. A universalist understanding of salvation through Him, then, would undermine His own words. We’ll hit a few more of the passages on your list along the way.

Jesus is exclusive in His preaching. Not only does He declare certain persons to be outside of the Kingdom of God, but He even makes His speech obscure to those He deems unworthy to understand His words! We see Him making a distinction between those inside and outside the Kingdom in Matthew 11:25–30, among many other places, and His intentional obscuring of His speech in His parables in Mark’s gospel.

Matthew 11:25–30 is at once a comforting and humbling if not offensive passage. Here we have Jesus’s prayer of thanks to the Father that He hasn’t made wisdom and understanding a condition of salvation, but has graciously revealed His salvation to “little children.” Well, the next statements out of Jesus’s mouth will seem jarring, especially if we consider Him simply a great teacher or enlightened human being. In verse 27, He claims that His relationship to God the Father is so exclusive that no one else can know the Father unless Jesus reveals the Father to them. Here Jesus goes even beyond His words in John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but by me.” Not only is Jesus the only way to the Father, He is the only one who determines whether a person can even come to the Father. If Jesus does not reveal the Father to a person, that person cannot know the Father. Not only is Jesus the door (John 10:7), here He says that He opens and shuts the door as He sees fit.
But then, in the next verse, Jesus seems to open the door of salvation wide: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” If we believe that Jesus is not contradicting Himself here, we have to reconcile this free offer of the gospel with Jesus’s own exclusive words. Many theologians have consolidated the verses in this passage by understanding that there is both a hidden and revealed will of God. The hidden will we see in Jesus’s own determination of who is saved; the revealed will we see in Jesus’s offer of salvation to all who would come and take it.

The apostle John records another instance of the exclusive bent in Jesus’s teaching. In a heated exchange, Jesus castigates the Pharisees for their blindness. Here are some of the more exclusive statements that Jesus makes:
- "All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out." John 6:37
- "No one can come to me unless that Father who sent me draws Him. And I will raise him up on the last day," John 6:44
- "The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was would would betray Him). And He said, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father." John 6:64b-65.

I encourage you to read the chapter in full. Note that verse 39 is one of those 'all' verses, but is qualified by Jesus to "all that [the Father] has given [him]." Here, the 'all' is meant to emphasize the absolute safety of all who trust in Jesus, and does not indicate the number who are saved. It's a statement about the extent of Jesus's protection, not the scope. Matthew 22:1-14 is another passage of similar kind.

I hope these thoughts are helpful. Let me know what you think!
