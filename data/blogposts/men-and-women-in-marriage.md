I'm working my way through _Gospel-Shaped Marriage_ by Chad and Emily Van Dixhoorn.

A key distinctive in the book is the authors' placement of the married state in its proper redemptive-historical context. On this side of heaven, all Christian marriages are between humans who are both sinners and saints. As those who are being purified on our way to glory, we expect (and learn from the Scriptures) that the believer grows into more of a saint and less of a sinner. This is from Lord, who is the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:18).ยน

This perspective enables a spouse to see their other half as midstream in the sanctifying process. And the great calling of marriage is to facilitate the Spirit's work in them.

With that nugget in mind, I've gathered some of the most poignant thoughts from the chapters on the wife's and husband's roles in marriage. Of course, there is much gold in the other chapters, but these two contain much that is worth meditating on.

### Chapter 4 - Women and Marriage

_Submission is respect that leads to serving. But in marriage, submission is also another aspect of live - to submit is to give yourself up for someone. To submit to someone is to make room for the other and his or her ideas. To submit is to listen and to follow. To submit is to put someone else first. To submit is to do what someone else asks, even when it is hard._ p 48

_It is important to see that submission is more than a mere duty. It is not just one task that she does. No, submission refers to a role, even more than that, a perspective or orientation that characterizes how she does what she does._ p 49

[Paul's inclusion of "as to the Lord" in 5:22] _must mean that the same attitude that foes into giving oneself to Jesus Christ should go into giving oneself to a husband._ p 49

_In thinking about Ephesians 1:23 ("[the church is] the body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all"), Matthew Henry's commentary on the Bible tries to explain Paul's point by analogy: What is a king without his kingdom? What is a head without a body? What is a mediator without his people? John Calvin says that it is "as if a father should say, 'My house seems empty when I do not see my children in it.' A husband will say, 'I seem to be only half a man when my wife is not with me.'"_ p 50

_"It is not that the authority [of Jesus and a husband] is equal." The point is that "wives cannot obey Christ without yielding obedience to their husbands."_ p 51

_A husband will usually be helping himself, and sometimes his wife, when he makes it his pattern to ask his wife for her opinion or judgement on a matter. Wise men consult wise wives and, as much as possible, make decisions with their full concurrence, not to share the blame if things go wrong but to maximize the chance that it will go right._ p 58

_A loving marriage sees work for oneself more quickly than work for one's spouse._ p 60

### Chapter 5 - Men and Marriage

_Our Lord did not come to one who was beautiful but to one who needed to __become__ beautiful, and He stays with her throughout that process._ p 64

_If a husband want to help his wife, it is better for him to ask himself some diagnostic questions:_

1. Are you loving her with all that you are and all that you have? In other words, do you, like Christ, love your wife deeply, sacrificially, purposefully, and faithfully?
2. Are you praying for her and studying your spouse so that you can pray for her better?
3. What is your aim in your prayers? Is your prayer really for her? Or for you? What answers to your prayers can be seen?
4. Are you leading devotions that profit her? Are you trying to study the Bible and Christian doctrine so that what you say will be thoughtful and useful?
5. Does she know that you love her? Or does every moment with you feel like a teaching or improving moment for her?
6. Do you ensure that she has the time to study God's word herself or with friends?
p 65

_Too often husbands are tempted to think that a monologue, a shake of the head, even a glare or an angry word is what they need to pass onto their spouse after she sins, especially if she sins against him. In our marriage, Emily has informed Chad that this is less of a blessing than he thinks. He has noticed that his negative signals do not make her task of respecting him any easier. We are to persuade our spouse with love. Christ did not demand that His church make herself beautiful. He worked to make her beautiful. Again, that is how Christ loved His bride._ p 66

_Brothers, do you want your wife to love you and respect you? Then respect her too, not reminding her of her own duties, but making her calling as easy as possible in a spirit of mutual submission and esteem._  
_Do you want  to make it easier for your wife to love you and respect you? Don't shout and complain and excuse your sin. Be men who admit your wrongs and model the gospel._  
_Do you want your wife to love you and respect you? Then love her as Christ loved the church. Be willing to sacrifice your own ambitions and plans for her - even your own life._ p 67

[Chad] _tries to help Emily by protecting and promoting four features in her life: regular Bible study, exercise, sufficient sleep, and and understanding husband._ p 68

_Sometimes when husbands see that something is broken, they rush to a diagnosis and to a cure. They too often think that they've understood everything on the spot. In their minds they're the clever detective, sizing up the situation in a flash and knowing exactly where they need to go next. In reality they're the doctor who half-listens to a complaint and then tells the patient to take two pills and call again in the morning. This is not what husbands want for themselves, and their wives don't want it either. Husbands need to seek understanding, and as God gives them insight, help their loved one to understand her own heart - the real cause of everyone's spiritual sickness._ pp 69-70

ยน Keller refers to this idea as the _glory-self_ of the spouse. He compares the spouse's view of their other as a majestic mountain that is often covered over with clouds. Every once in a while, the sky is clear and you catch a glimpse of what your partner will be like in glory. But the glimpse is often fleeting. It is your job, as the closest believer in their life, to look for these _glory-self_ moments and point them out to your spouse as a means of enouragement.
