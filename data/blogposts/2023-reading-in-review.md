## Total Book Count: 22

[Last year I had a lot of qualifying events](/blog/32/2022-reading-in-review) that made reading consistently rather difficult.

This year was a lot better!


Here are the books I read this year. Links are to [Westminster Bookstore](https://www.wtsbooks.com/), if they supply the book.

## Theology Proper


### _Foundations for Covenant Theology_ by Lane G. Tipton
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://reformedforum.org/product/foundations-of-covenant-theology-paperback" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/foundations-of-covenant-theology.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A beautiful little walkthrough on the first three chapters of the Bible. Engaging and accessible, this book is the most straightforward on-ramp to understanding the Garden of Eden and God's covenantal relationships with humans from a redemptive-historical perspective. The format is simple: a passage of Scripture, then a one- or two-paragraph explanation of the passage. The format is simple because comparing Scripture with Scripture is the best way to understand God's word. From the Scriptures we learn that Eden is on a mountain (Ezekiel 28:12-15), the Garden was an earthly replica of the invisible heavens (Psalm 104:2, Exodus 40:33-38, Psalm 78:69), and that Adam was meant for a higher, heavenly life with God. Adam failed, of course. Tipton shows the grace of God in giving the first Gospel word and sacrament in Genesis 3:15, which points to the Promised Seed. Highly recommend 10/10.

### _Covenantal Apologetics_ by K. Scott Oliphint
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/covenantal-apologetics-principles-and-practice-in-defense-of-our-faith-9781433576362" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/covenantal-apologetics.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I enjoyed the introduction of this volume, which traces the origins of reformed apologetics to the New Holland Reformation.

As the term _presuppositional apologetics_ has become loaded with multiple meanings in the last few decades, Oliphint has ditched it in for the term _covenantal apologetics_. Our task as apologists is to bring the unbeliever to see their responsibility to God under the covenant of works, to which all humans outside of Christ are bound. This is tantamount to bringing the realities of God's law and sin to bear in their consciousness.

Oliphint reminds us that apologetics involves both defending and commending the Christian faith. The former tears down the strongholds of unbelief and false doctrine in the heart of the unbeliever, after which the latter can be used for building up a proper understanding of the truth of God.

Particularly helpful was the discussion on Persuasion and Proof. The idea that God's existence can be "proved" with 100% certainty is not a realistic ask from the athiest; better is an approach that aims at persuasion.

My words here do not do the book justice!


<br />

### _Grace & Glory_ by Geerhardus Vos
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/grace-and-glory-sermons-preached-at-princeton-seminary-9781848719187" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/grace-and-glory.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>


This volume is an expanded edition of a collection of Vos's chapel addresses to seminarians at Princeton in the early 1900's. I read the original, which contained only five or six. This one has nineteen or twenty.

What can I say about Vos's sermons? They bring me face to face with Christ. I am moved to prayer and sweet communion with the Triune God whenever I read this dear man's writings.

The sermon that has stayed in my mind the most is the first, titled _The Wonderful Tree_, taken from Hosea 14:8 - _"O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an evergreen cypress; from me comes your fruit."_ Vos brings into the sermon the context Hosea's whole burden, showing that God wants to give Himself to His people, to be their fruition and blessedness. The Tree that God likens Himself to reminds us of two trees in particular - the tree of knowledge of good and evil as well as the tree of life in Revelation.

As with the prior book, my words do not do the author justice. I do believe this is the first time I've written on anything by Vos, which is a testament to how terrified I am to do so.

### _B. B. Warfield: Essays on his Life & Thought_ edited by Gary Johnson
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/b-b-warfield-gary-l-w-johnson-9781596380370?variant=9799638843439" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/b-b-warfield-essays.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A bit dry at times. Begins with a biographical sketch, followed by deep dives into various aspects of Warfield's legacy and its effects on the modern day. Includes his thoughts on the post-slavery era and Jim Crow, his apologetical sword-crossings with Kuyperians, his seminal work on inerrancy and his ambivalent relations with Fundamentalists in the church.

## Theology General

### _The Beauty and Glory of Christian Living_ edited by Joel Beeke
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-beauty-and-glory-of-christian-living-joel-r-beeke-9781601783356?variant=9795478552623" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/summary/beauty-and-glory-of-christian-living.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I wrote a full review of this book [here](/summary/11/beauty-and-glory-of-christian-living).

### _Making All Things New: Restoring Joy to the Sexually Broken_ by David Powlison
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/making-all-things-new-david-powlison-9781433556142?variant=9781890744367" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/making-all-things-new.jpg" size='large'/></a></div>

Powlison shows that every one of us are somewhere on the spectrum of sexual sin, whether the sin is ours or another's. Not only adultery or pornography/masturbation, but very look and every thought, even memories of past sins are included in this pale. "Where do you struggle with sex?" p 25.

What is the Gospel for those who have been sinned against, and those who are sinning? It is the hope of the gospel. Whether you're fighting to stay away from porn or struggling with the sin of others upon your body, whether you're at "level 1" or "level 40" in your warfare against sin, there is _still_ real sin occurring, and God's grace to us in Christ meets that depth of despair and woe. Renewal in Christ's image is a lifelong battle, it is deeper and wider than we initially think. As we begin the process of renewal, we find an increasingly subtle struggle against the not-so-blatant forms of sexual sin. Once we are oriented in the right direction and frame of mind with respect to the battle for renewal, we are ready to hear the simple advice of the wise author: Remember your "choice points" of weakness, recite God's promise to be with you, and walk with God as you talk with Him.

Powlison demonstrates that every one of us exist somewhere on the spectrum of sexual sin, whether the sin is ours or another's. He broadens our definition of sexual sin, so that we see our sin clearly. Then he points us to the hope of renewal, broadening our view to see how Christ helps to renew the wounded soul. And He helps us all with the same gospel. Psalm 25 - "Remember, O Lord, Your compassion and Your lovingkindnesses, for they have been from of old. Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to Your lovingkindness remember me, for Your goodness' sake, O Lord. ... For Your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is great." In effect, 'When God looks at me, will He remember my sin or His own mercies? O Lord, when you think about me, remember Yourself.'" p 46.


<br />

### _Mere Christianity_ by C. S. Lewis
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/mere-christianity-c-s-lewis-9780060652920?variant=10007092265007" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/mere-christianity.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

Lewis's conversational demeanor and striking metaphors make for an engaging read. Here is an inviting apologetic for the truth of the Christian faith.

Lewis starts with the Law, explicating Romans 1 (though never directly referencing it) and concluding Part I with a chapter entitled "We have Cause to be Uneasy". Part II explains the gospel in beautiful Christ-centered fashion - Christ was the perfect penitent who took on our sin so that we could become sons of God. Part III sketches the outworking of Christian behavior in a social setting; Lewis believes that Christians living out the gospel will transform their societies. The treatise ends with a "theology" section: rather than simple practical moral-religion Lewis covers Christ's two natures, the Persons of the Trinity and God's tri-personal help in prayer, and the will of man. 

Many Christian readers will find the apologetic arguments familiar, because the book's widespread influence has democratized them down to the popular level. A few examples are helpful. The argument that Jesus must be either a liar, lunatic or Lord find its origin here. The idea that Jesus did not come to make bad people good, but dead people live is the central theme of Part IV, chapter 10, "Nice People or New Men." These are just two familiar arguments - there are many others that are less well-known but just as effective in conversation.

### _God of the Garden_ by Andrew Peterson
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/the-god-of-the-garden-thoughts-on-creation-culture-and-the-kingdom-9781087736952?variant=41044084654280" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/god-of-the-garden.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

Really enjoyed this read. Sadly, I did not write anything about the book while I read it, so I have little more than warm feelings when I think about it.


<br />

### _Competing Spectacles_ by Tony Reinke
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/summary/competing-spectacles.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I wrote a full-length review of this book [here](/summary/12/competing-spectacles).


<br />

### _One with God_ by Pierce Taylor Hibbs
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-God-Finding-Identity-Purpose/dp/B0C5Z3K9J7" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/one-with-god.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

Hibbs is a deeply engaging writer. His work always deserves to be read with a calm prayerful heart. Here he reminds us how refreshing communion with God is supposed to be.

His treatment of Paul's words in Philippians 4:12-13 is gold. Paul was a spiritual mountain climber, able to ascend and descend on the hills and valleys of God's providence.


<br />

### _Making Faith Magnetic_ by Daniel Strange
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/making-faith-magnetic-five-hidden-themes-our-culture-cant-stop-talking-about-and-how-to-connect-them-to-christ-1-9781784986506" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/making-faith-magnetic.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

The Magnetic points are the poles of our existential consciousness, the five concepts that are always on our minds in some manner. Totality, Norm, Deliverance, Destiny, Higher Power. As image bearers of God, each of these points finds its fullest fulfillment for us in Christ. 

By training ourselves to spot these points in common conversation, we can connect our faith with our friends and acquaintances. We are enabled to apply a theological-cultural presuppositional apologetical approach. We unmask the idol the unbeliever has set up in place of Christ by their pursuit of fulfillment of one or more of these points, then show how our Lord is the subversive fulfillment of that point. A down-to-earth read by an author who knows how hard evangelism is, and who makes it easier for us to do to God's glory.

<br />

### _Knowing the Trinity_ by Ryan M. McGraw
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Trinity-Practical-Thoughts-Daily-ebook/dp/B073QZ2L6B" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/knowing-the-trinity.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A concise, engaging devotional on the trinitarian passages of the Bible. The application questions at the end of each paragraph are good springboards for meditation and prayer.

<br />

### _Terraform_ by Propaganda
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Building-Better-World-Propaganda/dp/006303624X" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/terraform.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>


What a wild ride. Propaganda believes that we make culture, and culture makes us. So let's make culture awesome. Each chapter culminates in a "terraforming project" for the reader to remake the world around them. The projects are designed to slow us down, consider the earth and the people around us, and how we can make both better. I wrote down a few of the projects and intend to implement them - try a day without Google maps, get a new hobby, pay attention to your rituals to name a few. Peppered throughout the prose are poems and raps, many of which paint the evils of chattel slavery and the struggle of black people. My struggle with the book is two-fold: those poems, in which white people seemingly at large are painted as complicit in slavery, and his quoting of Pete Enns and ambivalence on whether Genesis 1 is historical are quite alarming.

A cute aside - I use a product called <a href="https://www.terraform.io" target="_blank">terraform</a> at work every day.

<br />

### _J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography_ by Humphrey Carpenter
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/J-R-R-Tolkien-Biography-Humphrey-Carpenter/dp/0618057021" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/j-r-r-tolkien-bio.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

A fun and whimsical look at the author of one of society's greatest authors. The insight into Tolkien's mind and his decades-long struggle to produce and perfect the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is very comforting to this mediocre writer with young children who oftentimes strains to join two sentences together.


<br />

### _Zeitoun_ by Dave Eggers
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zeitoun-Eggers-Dave-2010-06-15-Paperback/dp/B012YSU0BY" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/zeitoun.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

This was a great read, but the subtle (and at times not-so-subtle) hagiographical protrayal of the main character generated enough suspicion in me to google the family. The results were unfortunate. I am arabic, so I have a lot of thoughts about this. I'll keep them to myself.


<br />

### _The Count of Monte Cristo_ by Alexandre Dumas
<div className="postImageContainer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Count-Monte-Cristo-Bantam-Classics/dp/0553213504" target="_blank"><BookHover imageUri="/blogpost/count-of-monte-cristo.jpg" size='large' /></a></div>

I could not put this book down. Loved it.
