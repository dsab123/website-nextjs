The above prayer an excerpt from __The Servant in Battle__, taken from [__Valley of Vision__: A Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Vision-Collection-Puritan-Devotions/dp/0851512283/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=valley+of+vision&qid=1673129665&sr=8-1).

Two simple reflections on this portion of the prayer:
- The servant sees himself in the battle _on the right side_, and
- The servant sees himself in the battle _at the right time_.

---------
### There is a battle
Perhaps obviously and as a precondition of the above reflections, yet worthy of consideration, is that the servant sees himself in _a_ battle. 

The apostle reminds us that  "we battle not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places (Ephesians 6:12)." He also counsels Timothy his protege: "Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him (2 Tim 2:3,4)." The battle between our Father and Satan is a real battle, even though we don't see swords clashing. John divides the lines of the battle in plain simple language: "We know that we are from God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one." (1 John 5:19)

This servant at his most basic level, is a Christian believer who reads his bible and believes what it says. He knows himself to be in a battle, and his role in the battle is that of a soldier.

### On the Right Side

Our servant "contends" in the battle. The victory does not always appear to belong to him and the skirmishes do him damage. He contends with a strong and subtle enemy. It would be one thing if the enemy were strong and direct, but this foe feigns in one direction yet attacks from another. Satan comes to each believer in battle as one robed in light (2 Corinthians 11:14), aiming to deceive rather than fight head-on; he wraps his attacks in good garb.

The servant's greatest weapon here is his memory. When the temptation presses hard, he _remembers_ the Lord Jesus. Though he may struggle against each of the enemy's blows, he remembers again that Christ Jesus did not weaken in faith when tempted, but conquered. And the servant is on His side. He believes that the battle will end in victory. He believes that the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of his God.

### At the Right Time

And until then, the burden of the battle's end is not his to bear. The battle between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent has been raging on for centuries; he was born into the conflict. So with us. We were born into Christ into the midst of the battlefield, in the middle of the battle. 

The servant looks backward in time to Calvary, where (when?) the head of the serpent-turned-dragon was crushed. Satan's defeat was there finalized. Though he is (now) subtle and crafty, he has already been overcome.

Here the servant places himself in the battle, as should we. We know we are weak and have little strength; Jesus knows it too: "I know you have but little power" (Revelation 3:8). Since we are united to Christ, we find ourselves following in His footsteps. We feel the attacks from the evil one. He too has suffered under Satan's blows. He too has felt the serpent licking at his heel (Genesis 3:15). His body was sown in weakness (1 Corinthians 15:20).

So the servant in our prayer takes comfort that Christ has known the battle before he did. So as he feels his heel, indeed his whole humanity, under assault, he remembers not only that Jesus knows his pain. He also remembers that Jesus has crushed the serpent's head. Christ's heel-bruising was in fact Satan's head-crushing. We fight __before__ the battle is finished, but __after__ it has already been won. The servant remembers that God has promised that he will conquer in Christ at the right time - soon. "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet."  Romans 16:20.
