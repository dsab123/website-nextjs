I have the privilege of serving as an elder at [Acacia Reformed Church](https://arcopc.org).

Our practice during morning worship is to read through a chapter of the bible in addition to the passage that is preached, and to briefly summarize it and show how it teaches us about Christ. We're making our way through Isaiah right now.

Here are my attempts for Isaiah 25 through 35.


---


### Isaiah 25

Here in Isaiah 25, we zoom in on Mount Zion after the Lord delivers His people, particularly starting in verse 6.

There is a universal celebration for all people on the Mountain, and the Lord is the master of ceremonies.

Three things the Lord does on this mountaintop celebration: He prepares a feast for all people, He swallows up death, and He wipes away tears.

Paul cues us in on when this celebration happens in full. He quotes this passage in 1 Corinthians: "Death is swallowed up in victory", applying it to the final resurrection.

This victory, this blessed eternal life with God, who is there on the mountain, and whom we behold, comes to us, Paul says, through our Lord Jesus Christ.


### Isaiah 26

Isaiah 26 features opposites - building up and tearing down, recalling Ecclesiastes. There is a time for each.

‘In that Day’, that is, the end of days, God’s people will see the completed Building, His deliverance as if it were strong walls, keeping every evil outside. That is the time to come, in the future.

Right now, the lofty cities are being laid low, so low that the poor trample on it, verse 6.

The Lord is also building right now, verse 11 - ‘Your hand is lifted up’, but is not seen. The world then, and now, does not see the work of God in building His Heaven, His kingdom, His church. But it is happening.

So certain is Isaiah of this future outcome that he exhorts us who dwell in the dust, as pilgrims on the earth, to awake and sing for joy. 

Because the final resurrection is coming, not through our efforts, but through our Savior Jesus Christ, who will come out from His place to judge the earth at the last day.


### Isaiah 27

Isaiah continues to give us vision after vision of the end, when God judges all people and avenges His enemies.

Here, he sings of a pleasant vineyard, gardened by God Himself. He dares anyone to come against Him with thorns and briars, challenging them to make peace with Him, to force Him to a treaty, if they dare.

The problem, Isaiah would have realized, is that the vineyard of God's people, Israel, have not been pleasant and have not bone him fruit. Twice already Isaiah has received words from the Lord likening His people to a vineyard, and one case they have yielded wild bitter grapes, and in the other, no grapes. The rest of the chapter is a sad retelling of this story.

There is a more primal garden referenced here, however, and that is the Garden of Eden. Remember the serpent who deceived Adam, and because of our first parents' sin the ground was cursed. So God's people consequently are unable to produce good fruit.

That is why God slays the serpent, the dragon.

Jesus also writes Himself into the story of God's vineyard, declaring that He is the true vine. He is the shoot from the almost-barren stump of Jesse, the root out of dry ground that brings pleasure to God.

And as we abide in Him, our vineyard, with God as our gardener, we bear much fruit.


### Isaiah 28

God's ways are not our ways, and His ways are past finding out. That's the point of the parable at the end of the chapter.

Leading up to it, we see God's surprising ways in judging His people. 

Israel at this time was flirting with Egypt, creating alliances with them to avoid capture by Assyria. Can you imagine Israel seeking help from Egypt, who enslaved them for hundreds of years? 

And the rulers of Israel, both in the North and the South, were proud about this. The North was drunk with pride, and the South boasted that they even had Death on their side.

The prophet predicts that the Lord will send His own mighty one to destroy them, fulfilled in part by a foreign nation. He will use the wicked to judge His own people. It should have been the other way around. That's why He calls it His strange work.

But there is always hope. God promises that once their crown is laid low, He Himself will be the crown of His people, and once their covenant with death is seen to be broken, He will be the cornerstone that provides eternal stability to His people. 

We know this Crown and this Cornerstone. It's our Savior.

### Isaiah 29

One of the great takeaways from the book of Isaiah is that God is sovereign. Isaiah will soon teach us there is no other God beside Him, and He does all His holy will unimpeded. Even more, He uses the wicked, in their wickedness, to accomplish this.

We read here of the sovereign Lord's relentless pursuit to perfect His people.

Their hearts are seeking alliances with other nations, making evil covenants and keeping their hearts far from the Lord.

What is the sovereign Lord's reaction? To humble His people, then to raise them up afterwards.

He reminds them that He is the potter, and they are the clay. He will bring siegeworks on His people, lay them low to the ground, multiply their enemies, and then provide an instantaneous deliverance by visiting His people.

And His visitation, we read in verse 14, will bring wonder upon wonders. A complete inversion, or you could say restoration, to the way things are - the wild forests of Lebanon yielding good fruit, the deaf hearing, the eyes seeing, and the meek obtaining joy in the Lord.

Jesus set these things in motion when He came to this earth, and He will finish restoring them when He returns. Then the meek will inherit the earth, as He promised.

### Isaiah 30

Israel goes down to Egypt. How absurd for her to seek refuge in her former slave owner.

They want their prophets to abandon the word of the Lord. They could not accept the yoke of being conquered, of living a peaceful and quiet life, but wanted to fight against God's design.

The Lord promises a ruthless purifying in response to this large-scale iniquity.

And he waits to be gracious to them, verse 18. His deliverance will take time, time enough for His people to come to realize their prodigal state, and to cry out for mercy. As soon as the discipline has its intended effect, repentance, the Lord will remove it and will welcome his restored children to the right path. He follows the same pattern with us.

He will come and destroy Israel's enemies while they cheer Him on  - "every stroke of the appointed staff" "will be with tambourines and lyres."

Theese words of the Lord are repeated by the Lord Jesus, who warned of the fires of Hell, and promises to execute that wrath and save all who believe in Him.


### Isaiah 31

Help from man will fail, because the Lord is the one who will bring disaster. We'll see how the Assyrians fall by a heavenly sword in a few chapters.

Amidst the people's sin in allying themselves with foreign earthly powers, God promises a strong and sweet deliverance. Strong like a lion, and sweet like birds hovering.

The imagery of birds hovering is used by the Lord very often. In the first verses of the Bible the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The Lord rescues His children form Egypt as if borne on eagles wings. He promises to rise upon them with healing in His wings in Malachi.

Jesus uses the same imagery in Matthew, longing to gather Israel together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings.

The Lord will accomplish this deliverance, even though His people do not deserve it. They will cast their idols and evil alliances away. The Lord Jesus does the same for us by His grace, purifying is for Himself.


### Isaiah 32

The Lord makes two promises to His people, who have corrupted justice in His kingdom: A king will reign in righteousness, and His people with have His Spirit.

The effect of these promises is to invert the current state of things. When the King comes, He will judge with righteousness. The poor and the best will no longer be taken advantage of. Affliction and evil are often described as heat and barrenness, so the King will be like a shadow to hide under.

And until the Spirit is poured out, the land will be barren and fruitless.

We know who the King is, and we know when the Spirit was poured out. Jesus is reigning, and he poured out His Spirit upon the church at Prntecost.

Brothers and sisters, because of the work of Christ, we are that fruitful field beside the still waters. We bear the fruit of the Spirit even now. Paul tells us we are God's field, and desires fruit to abound to our account.

Praise the Lord that He makes us His fruitful field!



### Isaiah 33

In this chapter, as we've seen from Isaiah regularly, the destruction of the wicked coincides with the salvation of the righteous. 

Zeroing in on verse 14, we find a problem for the sinners in Zion: how can they dwell with the consuming fire, the everlasting burnings? And the answer is a list of requirements that looks very similar to Psalm 15, and impossible for us to fulfill. In that Psalm, fellowship with God is compared to dwelling on His holy mountain. Here, it is dwelling with Him as a consuming fire.

This image of the church dwelling with God is first given to Moses by the Lord when He appears to him in the burning bush. The question needs to be asked today: how can we, who are sinful, full of sin, dwell with God?

The answer is foreshadowed to us in verse 17: "the King in His beauty!" It is the great King, the King of Kings, who will solve that problem for His people, purifying them by His blood, so that they can not only endure but enjoy the presence of God in the heavenly city.




### Isaiah 34

God through Isaiah proclaims His judgement on all nations, particularly Edom.

The Lord has a sword that will be gorged with their blood. He then gives dominion of the Edomites' land to wild animals, and causes thorns to grow rampant, in a reversal of the created order.

We could ask the question, "Why, Lord?"

The answer is the middle verse: "For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion."

Edom was particularly nasty to their brother nation, Israel. Obadiah and Amos detail their evils. The Lord hears His people's cry, and promises to avenge them. 

But this prophecy has a still unfulfilled cosmic element. The Lord begins His judgement from the heavens, rolling them up like a scroll. This end-time judgement has not yet occurred. The wrath of God is still revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness.

On that day, God will judge the evils in the earth and the heavens through Jesus Christ. All for the cause those who are united to Him.

### Isaiah 35

In this last prophecy before switching to narrative, Isaiah recalls themes he's given us before.

On the day the Lord returns He will bring with Him a reward for His people and an end to their affliction, in a return to Edenic times. The wastelands will become fruitful beyond measure. And he encourages the people with these words.

In verse 5, the imagery of Eden blends in miraculous healings. The Lord Jesus performed these signs in His earthly ministry. He has already begun to bring this Day of the Lord!

Isaiah next speaks of this Way of Holiness which secures safe passage to the Heavenly Zion. We know from Psalm 1 that this way of the righteous is known by the Lord. And it makes its most famous of appearances in New Testament, when Jesus says in John 14 that He is the Way. He promises secure passage to heaven, even for the simplest of us, if we trust in Him.
