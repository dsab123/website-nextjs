One of the things I like to do is collect important phrases and quotes from my reading. 
<br></br>

Here are some interesting excerpts and summary statements from the first four chapters of _Sapiens_, by Yuval Noah Harari. 
<br></br>

_You'll notice that each chapter summary gets longer; this is because the book is so engrossing. There is too much good writing in this volume. I highly recommend getting yourself a copy, which you can do through my affiliate link <a href="https://amzn.to/3bJjxiS" target="_blank">here</a>._
<br></br>

As a Christian, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but can still recommend his work. We should read those who disagree with what we believe (see Chapter 5 of <a href="https://danielsabbagh.com/summary/4/lit" target="_blank">this book summary</a>). Unfortunately, far too often dialogue between those who hold to opposing viewpoints is littered with the stubbly remains of poor strawmen who have been beaten to death. Against this backdrop, Harari's ability to correctly explain Christian belief is very refreshing. I consider this an gift because it is so rare.
<br></br>

If only we could disagree with each other charitably, and state what the other person believes accurately!
<br></br>

## Chapter 1 — An Animal of No Significance

First few paragraphs are captivating! Starting at the most basic of particles, Harari zooms out little by little, introducing us to the relationship between physics, chemistry, and biology along the way, to stop at history.

He labors to make the distinction between Homo Sapiens and the other "human" species known.
	- This is the high point of his labors, it seems to me: "Sapiens were already very different from Neandethals and Denisovans not only in their genetic code and physical traits, but also in their cognitive and social abilities, yet it appears it was still just possible, on rare occasions, for a Sapiens and a Neanderthal to produce a fertile offspring. So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express. It is unsettling — and perhaps thrilling — to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce children together." p. 17'

It is possible that Sapiens (which we are) killed out all other "human" species.

## Chapter 2 — The Tree of Knowledge

I feel that Harari pejoratively titles the first few chapters of the book using Christian language, but it sure is entertaining!

Somehow (Harari asserts no one knows), Sapiens gained extraordinary cognitive abiliities. This was possibly due to some extreme conditions they had to endure. Harari calls this the "Tree of Knowledge" (p 21) mutation. The cognitive ability stemming from this mutation separated Sapiens from the other "humans", most notably in their (our?) use of language. "What was so special about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?" (p 22). His answer is that "our language is amazingly supple" (p 22). Sapiens learned to describe not only things that were there, i.e. "there's a lion at the watering hole", but things that weren't there. Harari calls these things fictions. From these fictions emerged all religions and tribal legends. What's more, modern Sapiens still engage in fiction-telling. He goes into detail on the history of Peugeot, one of the first Limited Liability Corporations. As an LLC, Peugeot does not consist of, or exist in, its employees, or its factories, or products. It is a fictional entity. So with Christianity, Islam, and many other invisible systems we have created in order to accomplish things. At this moment you'd expect him to lash into organized religion and explain why it is an evil that must be abolished. However, he does something unexpected: he says that these fictions are important because they allow us to engage in these myths collectively, that is, with other Sapiens. "Any large-scale human corporation — whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe — is rooted in common myths that exist only in people's collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States are rooted in common national myths." (p 27). "Our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis" as these religious or national myths (p 28). And it was these kind of myths that allowed Sapiens to "conquer the world", whether in hunting groups of animals (or tragically, other "humans"), or in tearing down a forest to produce an apartment complex.
- I must commend him on his accurate representation of Christian teaching! It's refreshing when someone who disagrees with you is able to state your position accurately.

## Chapter 3 — A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve

Harari sketches with care the most likely activities of the Sapiens, while respecting that there is much we don't know. We have objective information about their health and eating habits, but are virtually clueless with respect to their religious beliefs and each Sapiens bands' interaction with one another. Knowing these things is important because "our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment, with its mega-cirities, aeroplanes, telephones and computers." (p 41).

With regard to religious belief, Sapiens were probably animists of some kind. But we can't press deeper: "Instead of erecting mountains of theory over a molehill of tomb relics, cave paintings and bone statuettes, it is better to be frank and admit that we have only the haziest notions about the religions of ancient foragers." (p 55).

"There's hardly an activity, a belief, or even an emotion that is not mediated by objects of our own devising" (p 43), Harari says. In the context he is explaining why we cannot rely on physical artifacts too much to learn about our ancestors, who were nomadic and did not have many possessions.
- What is the relation between his statement and the Christian Sacraments? God knows our need for physical objects and mediates HIs grace to us through them
- Consider Elisha's supernatural curing of the "death in the pot" by the use of flour, which was acting like a sacrament to ease the prophets' consciousnesses enough to allow them to eat.

"This curtain of silence" (that is, not knowing about much of our ancestors' lives) "shrouds thens of thousands of years of history. … This curtain is so thick that we cannot even be sure [speculations about Napoleons or Beethovens of the era] [existed] — let alone describe them in detail." (p 61).

"Scholars tend to ask only those questions that they can reasonably expect to answer. Without the discovery of as yet unavailable research tools, we will probably never know what the ancient foragers believes or what political dramas they experienced. Yet it is vital to ask questions for which no answers are available, otherwise we might be tempted to dismiss 60,000 of 70,000 years of human history with the excuse that ‘the people who lived back then did nothing of importance.'" (p 61).

## Chapter 4 — The Flood

Prior to the "cognitive revolution", Homo sapiens lived on the afro-asian land mass. How did we end up with Sapiens colonies (bones, signs of life? Harari does not how we know Sapiens lived there) on the islands dating back to 45,000 years ago, Australia in particular? The majority theory is that soon after the cognitive revolution, Sapiens living on the Indonesian archipelago developed the technology to cross the sea and also "developed the first seafaring societies." (p 64).

"Though archaeologists have yet to unearth rafts, oars or fishing villages that date back as far as 45,000 years ago (they would be difficult to discover, because rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian shoreline under 300 feet of ocean) Nevertheless, there is strong circumstantial evidence to support this theory." (p 64, emphasis mine).

"The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history, at least as important as Columbus's journey to America or the Apollo II expedition to the moon. It was the first time any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system — indeed, the first time any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross from Afro-Asia to Australia. Of even greater importance was what the human pioneers did in this new world. The moment the first hunter-gatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the moment that Homo sapiens climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a particular landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals of planet Earth." (p 64).

All of the huge Australian flora that lived on Australia became extinct except for one. "Food chains throughout the entire Australian ecosystem were broken and rearranged. It was the most important transformation of the Australian ecosystem for millions of years. Was it all the fault of Homo sapiens?"

Harari spends some time arguing that if Homo sapiens are not completely at fault, they most certainly share in the blame. Others might try to exonerate Homo sapiens, citing the shift in Australia's climate that happened around the same time, but Harari refutes them, citing many proofs, the most convincing in my view being that mass extinctions allegedly followed Sapiens' arrival on a new landmass. "The Maoris, New Zealand's first Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species. A similar fate befell the mammoth population of Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean (125 miles north of the Siberian coast). … Were the Australian extinction an isolated event, we could grant humans the benefit of the doubt. But the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer." (p 67); "this ecological tragedy was restaged in miniature countless times after the Agricultural revolution." (p 72).

"All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? There are three explanations that meld quite nicely." (p 67)." He goes on to detail these explanations. "Without further evidence, there's no way of deciding between these three scenarios. But there are certainly good reasons to believe that if Homo sapiens had never gone Down Under, it would still be home to marsupial lions, diprotodons and giant kangaroos." (p 69).

Harari next describes how Sapiens crossed over to America — this time they had not to deal with crossing sea, but land at extremely cold temperatures. "At first, glaciers blocked the way from Alaska to the rest of America, allowing no more than perhaps a few isolated pioneers to investigate the lands further south. However, around 12,000 BC global warming melted the ice and opened an easier passage. Making use of the new corridor, people moved south en masse, spreading over the entire continent. Though originally adapted to hunting large game in the Arctic, they soon adjusted to an amazing variety of climates and ecosystems. … The human blitzkrieg across America testifies to the incomparable ingenuity and the unsurpassed adaptability of Homo sapiens" (p 70).

"The Americas were a great laboratory of evolutionary experimentation, a place where animals and plants unknown in Africa and Asia had evolved and thrived. But no longer." (p 71). Sapiens wiped out many of the thriving fauna.

"Again, some scholars try to exonerate Homo sapiens and blame climate change (which requires them to posit that, for some mysterious reason, the climate in the Caribbean islands remained static for 7,000 years while the rest of the western hemisphere warmed). But in America, the dung ball cannot be dodged. We are the culprits. There is no way around that truth. Even if climate change abetted us, the human contribution was decisive." (p 72)
- "the dung ball cannot be dodged"; what a delightful writer this man is!

"The First Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the foragers, was followed by the Second Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the farmers, and gives us an important perspective on the Third Wave Extinction, which industrial activity is causing today. Don't believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. … We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology. Perhaps if more people were aware of the First Wave and Second Wave extinctions, they'd be less nonchalant about the Third Wave they are part of. If we knew how many species we've already eradicated, we might be more motivated to protect those that still survive." (p 74).

"Among all the world's large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves in Noah's Ark." (p 74).    
- What an amazing sentence! Wonderful double-entendre here, Harari. You begin the chapter entitled "The Flood" by talking about how humans crossed the sea to Australia, but here reveal the true flood of which you were speaking the whole time — the human flood across the world that eradicates and domesticates animals to their liking. Genius writing.

I won't engage full-on with his writing in this post, but I will note I found myself often wondering about Harari's motivation to write. If all that he says is true, humanity is nothing more than a blight on the face of the earth. Later on in the book (which you'll have to <a href="https://amzn.to/3bJjxiS" target="_blank">purchase</a>), Harari details more atrocities that modern man has committed against the world and himself. If so, does humanity need to exist anymore? Would it be better for the world that we don't? 

He himself has almost said as much in interviews. He remarks that he finds it odd that giant tech companies invite him to speak on the future of man-robot integration (which he devotes a whole chapter to) when all he says about man is gloom and doom.
