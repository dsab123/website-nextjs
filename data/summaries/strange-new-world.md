If you have been puzzled by the breakneck speed of the trans movements' recent success, both in the law courts and in public opinion, Carl Trueman has written a book for you. 

He begins by considering the statement "I am a woman trapped in a man's body". A common phrase we hear on the news now, but one that would have puzzled our grandparents' generation. To make such a statement in those days would be risking a stay at a mental asylum.

How did this tectonic shift occur in the West in less than fifty years?

A professional historian, Trueman reminds us that it's impossible to say with certainty that X caused Y caused Z when we study history. Nevertheless he offers a plausible timeline of how we got here, by tracing the development of the modern self over the last few centuries. At least, it seems plausible to me. I have to admit my double blindness on these matters - I'm neither an historian nor an expert on the sexual revolution. But man, was this an enjoyable read, perhaps more enjoyable because of my ignorance on these matters.

Names like Marx, Rousseau and Freud are somewhat commonplace today. Before reading this book I knew Marx was the father of Socialism, Nietzche informed us that we'd killed God and Freud made everything about sex. But that was the extent of my knowledge. The service that Trueman performs for us is to walk through the last few hundred years, demonstrating how these thinkers' ideas took hold and got us to where we are.

Chapter One defines some helpful terms, social imaginary chief among them. A social imaginary is a shared subconscious framework that defines standards, rituals and acceptable patterns. There are many imaginaries, and each one is shared more or less among a group of people. The social imaginary changes over time, of course. (I highly recommend doing more reading on this concept, as it's not easy to define, let alone understand). The author's plan to make sense of where we are with regard to the modern self: to trace the thoughts of thinkers who were aware of or perhaps precipitated the shifts in the social imaginary of their time. Effectively, the goal is trace the changes in the social imaginary of the last few hundred years with regard to the idea of the self.

Chapters Two through Five comprise the sweeping historical section of the book. _Expressive Individualism_ is the term used to define the Romantics' enlightenment-reactionary view that the inner thoughts of the individual deserve to see more airtime in common life. "Man is born free but everywhere [in society] he is in chains" is Rousseau's most famous line in his _Confessions_. Institutions and cultural norms are a straitjacket that prohibit the carefree spirit of man, compelling him to live life in a way he does not want. Romantic poets and artists spread these ideas far and wide, and the social imaginary matured accordingly. (I saw this same idea presented by Thoreau in _Walden_.) (make anchor on that blogpost and link it here)

Once expressive individualism took root in the west, it was only a matter of time until the societal bedrock of 'God' was no longer needed. If God does not define the bounds of my life, I must possess the freedom to discover them. This bedrock of 'God' has a long tail, however, and still exerts a heavy influence even today. 

(As a Christian I lament that this God-consciousness is not more foundational in our society. The Bible teaches in Romans 1 that this God-consciousness, or ['sense of the divine'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensus_divinitatis), actually is foundational to at least the human psyche. What a benefit to society it would be if what is true in each of us, namely our God-given awareness of God and our need to acknowledge and obey Him, was true in our social imaginary? But I digress.)

Nietzsche perceived that the rise of expressive individualism was a sign of society's gradual loss of a need for God. Aware of the impending impact, he sounded the alarm. His solution was a gospel of self-creation. Each person must rise up in this new godless world as their own "Superman", defining their own purpose for existence.

Before Nietzsche, Marx had posited that all human relationships are economic at root. When this took hold in the social imaginary, Nietzsche's Superman was ready to fill the void. Combine these two with Freud and Reich, who taught that all human relationships are sexual and that we can create a successful civilization without all the taboos forced upon us by Christianity and strict moral codes, and you've made it to where we are today, at least as far as the social imaginary is concerned.

But there has been another change in the last few decades that has drastically sped up our ability to act upon these ideas: the exponential growth in the technology available to us.

Never in past generations has it been possible to change your job, diet, geographic location, economic status and friends. These days you can even change your gender. This newfound flexibility has caused us to envision the world not as a firm rigid structure that you fit into, as in prior generations, but into a plastic kind of play-doh that you can mold to your will. This Psychologized Self, Trueman calls it, pairs very well with Nietzsche. In fact, it might be a direct result of his influence. My desires and feelings have become a part of who I am.

In Chapter 8, we learn that crucial aspects of the Psychologized Self has enshrined into law. This has ramifications for the western ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Where once free speech (including religious speech) allowed for the airing of opposing viewpoints, now vocalizing a minority view affects the felt identity of the majority, causing it to be deemed hate speech. Such speech must be silenced, if feelings are indeed part of the Self.

As the last influences of Christianity leave the modern social imaginary, we can expect this Strange New World to confront all of us at some point. How do we respond? Simply by living as faithful Christians, trusting that the the beauty of our worship, the effect of our organization and the strength of our community will bear fruit.

If you are a Reformed Christian, Trueman's specific recommendations will be very familiar - sing Psalms, organize, and live in vibrant community.

As a Reformed Christian I heartily "amen" Truman's recommendations. Yet I would have been helped if he would have teased these concepts down into the practical level. How should Christians "organize"? Asking such a question would necessitate an interaction with the Christian Nationalism we are hearing so much about. I totally get that these things weren't addressed here; for all I know Trueman's next book will tackle this question.

I also wonder how the later chapters on the recent successes of the extreme left would have been treated if Trueman wrote the book in 2025 as opposed to 2021. The vibe shift that grew out of Trump's 2024 win has lended a degree of honor to naming yourself as a conservative, or even Christian, and has at least slowed down the juggernaut of the Left's lawfare.
