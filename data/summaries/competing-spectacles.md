Tony Reinke's work is always a must-read. 

He writes at the intersection of theology and technology, a place where many theologians are aloof, oblivious or for historical reasons silent. Augustine's parishioners, for example, didn't have to deal with the rapid-fire distraction machines that are our iPhones. They did have theater shows though. Those ancient spectacles, with larger-than-life presentations of humor, lust and gore are the progenitors of our own modern ones. Ours spectacles are viral - they come to us individually (on our screens), with near absolute ubiquity, and at light-speed. 

Despite these differences, ours are part-and-parcel with their ancestors. An overindulgence in spectacle-watching deadens the soul, desensitizing it to the heinousness of sin and the vibrancy of embodied life. All spectacles across space and time are ultimately the same in their potential power over us. We also stand in unfortunate, unwitting solidarity with our human ancestors - our hearts are easily swept up by the trivial, lewd and violent. By detailing these modern spectacles, and our historic relationship of creation and idolatry with them, Reinke does us a great service. For knowing is half the battle. Spectac-ular moments easily sap our spiritual and mental strength. Our societal attentiveness has plummeted so hard that we can only pay attention for nine seconds. The view-er must beware and develop a healthy relationship with them. 

Against spectacles modern and ancient, Reinke opens our eyes to the Great Spectacle of the Gospel, the Godman on the Cross for us. An idolatry of the spectacle shrinks our soul; an adoring gaze at The Spectacle enlarges the heart (Psalm 119:32), enlightens the eyes (Psalm 13:3), and transforms us into that Image (Psalm 17:15, 2 Corinthians 3:18, 1 John 3:1-3).

In the book's final chaper, Reinke shares with us his supreme concern - Boredom with Christ. May we not become bored with Christ as we shrink to the size of our handheld spectacle-making machines! Rather, may we grow more and more enthralled with Christ as we gaze upon His beauty in His Church (Psalm 27:4), His Word (Psalm 119:105) and His Sacraments (1 Corinthians 11:24).

_I have meditated on the contents of this book often since I finished reading it. In hindsight I found it odd that there is no list of diagnostic questions or directives at the end to enable the reader to gauge their own relationship to the technology around them. I feel that this would have strengthened the long-term impact of the book upon the more serious reader bloc. Although as I write this I remember that Reinke's prior work entitled 12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You may contain such a list._

Here are some of my own questions and directives.

### Questions to Gauge your relationship to Spectacle-makers
  - Am I marveling at the Lord Jesus in His work as my Savior, Intercessor and Sanctifier? 
  - Am I enjoying my private devotions? I use this <a href="/blog/1/outline-for-bible-study" target="_blank">template</a> to stay focused when I'm studying God's word.
  - Is the Word of Christ dwelling richly in me? 
    - One way to gauge this is to look at my heart when I sing to the Lord in corporate worship. Colossians 3:16 - "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God."
  - What is your Screen Time report on your phone? Are there any noticeable analytics? A slow uptick over the past few months, or a sudden spike due to a stressful day?
		- Have I repented for the time foolishly spent on social media?

### Directives to Regulate your relationship to Spectacle-makers
  - Favor websites over apps - mobile websites tend to be less user-friendly. User-friendly from the perspective of social media giants entails that you, the user, use the website more and more, which is dangerous for the regulated relationship we seek.
  - Develop an outdoor hobby - my wife got me into gardening, of both the vegetable and plant variety. I've found that engaging the physical senses is a great deterrent to getting sucked into a media gluttony. 
  - Commit to re-evaluate my relationship with technology every week by honestly answering the Questions and reciting these Directives.
