This book is a collection of conference addresses from the 201 Puritan Reformed Conference. Each address can stand independently on its own, but all of them center around the beauty and glory of Christian living. The Christian life is likened to a tree where the roots are planted by divine grace, and the branches are grown by human cooperation with that grace.

Here are summaries, quotes and amalgamations from the chapters I found most stimulating.

### Chapter 1 - Living Out Our Faith: The Christian Life Inside Out

The book begins with a beautiful exposition and outline of Colossians 3:1-17, illustrating how the Christian life is styled from the inside out, from _principle_ to _procedure_, or indicative to imperative.

### Chapter 2 - Living By The Spirit's Sanctifying Ministry

Ian Hamilton looks at Romans 8, focusing on verses 12-14, and the role of the Spirit in empowering us to put sin to death. "The vigour, and power, and comfort of our spiritual life depend on the mortification of the deeds of the flesh." p 21.

Takeaways - 
	- Mortification is the proof that we are children of God (8:9); Mortification is the believer's unceasing obligation and duty, and is to be done in the power of the Spirit.
	- How does the Spirit aid in mortification? "The Holy Spirit comes to plant the graces of Christ in our lives. He plants those graces in the inhospitable soil of our hearts where sin still lingers. As those graces are watered by the Word of God, by prayer, by the ministry of God's people, and by the fellowship of the saints, they flourish and squeeze sin out of our lives." p 26 ❤️ 
	- "Put your faith in Christ, for He is the great sin-killer. Then, too, trust the Spirit of Christ, for He comes and says, 'Child of God, we can do it together.'" p 27 ❤️ 


### Chapter 3 - Living on Things Above: John Owen on Spiritual-Mindedness

Focuses on one of Owen's later and lesser-known work _The Grace and Duty of Being Spiritually Minded_, an exposition of Romans 8:6 - "For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."

"The 'minding of the Spirit' (as opposed to the minding of the carnal mind) is the actual exercise of the mind as renewed by the Holy Ghost, as furnished with a principle of spiritual life and light, in its conception of spiritual things and the setting of its affections on them, as finding that relish and savour in them wherewith it is pleased and satisfied," p 33

The minding of the Spirit includes three steps:
  1. Fixing the thoughts on the truths of God's Word and meditating on them day and night, p 33
  2. The Inclination of the heart, which will grow in proportion to the truth that we meditate on;
  3. The complacency of mind, in which the "gust, relish and savour" of spiritual things begins to move us.


### Chapter 4 - Living by the Means of Grace: How God Beautifies His Children

God's _proximate_ purpose is the beautification of His children, while His _ultimate_ purpose is to glorify Christ, to make Him "the firstborn of many brethren" (Romans 8:29), p 41.

All things in the life of the believer are means of God's grace (Romans 8:28). But particularly, the Word of God, prayer, the sacraments and church discipline, in the context of the Church, are the ways that God the Spirit "replicates" Christ in His people, p 44.

"You cannot have God for your Father unless you have the church for your Mother." Calvin


### Chapter 5 - Living in the Family: Thoughts from William Gouge

A survey of Gouge's "Building a Godly Home", a (mostly) timeless treatise on the ingredients of a godly home - where the husband is the loving head, the wife the joyful wife and mother, the children raised in fear of the Lord. 

The godly home is to be a little church and a little nation, raising up worshippers of God and faithful members of society for the propagation of the church by God's grace.

### Chapter 9 - Lining Morally in a Sexually Immoral World

A direct exposition of Proverbs 5 - Flee the Adulterous Woman, Delight in Your Wife, Tremble Before God. Simple and straightforward.

### Chapter 10 - Living Positively in a Negative Culture

An exposition of Philippians 4:8, demanding that "we choose a _deliberate imbalance_ in favor of what is inspirational and wholesome instead of the current imbalance on the side of what is dispiriting and gross", p 140.

What we feed our minds will come out in our cares and anxieties, so we should consume good and wholesome things.

Helpful quotes and questions:
	- "Paul urges is to seek out and celebrate right behavior, courageous actions, hardworking parents, loving fathers, devoted mother's, respectful children, happy families, gentle caregivers, honest employees, fair bosses and such", p 142.
	- "As you drive with your family, do you suggest topics that will show people in a good light or a bad light? Do you tell stories that will make your hearers praise God and others or that will make people doubt God and condemn others? Do you shield your children from the destructively critical spirit of talk radio and substitute stimulating and inspiring concentration? Do you thank God for the national reduction in crime, the worldwide rise in literacy, and so on?", p 143.
	- "As an experiment, why not try to go 24 hours without speaking negatively about anything or anyone?" p 144.
	- "Most of us don't need to glue ourselves to the TV and to Internet news. Instead, we should actively shield ourselves and our families from much of it", p 144.

### Chapter 12 - Living Hopefully in Hard Times: The Glory & Beauty of the Book of Judges

Judges is a hard, yet hopeful book. Hard because it witnesses some of the most evil acts humans could possibly commit, and hopeful because God's grace is shown to be even more shocking than human sin. What starts out as a relatively minor mishap-sin of God's people begins a spiritual decline in which first Israel forgets God, then ultimately commits some heinous idolatry. 

For their evil, God gives them up to evil powers to chasten them. The people remember the Lord as they bristle from the chastening, and cry out to Him for deliverance. He hears their cries and raises up for them a deliverer. 

And the cycle repeats.

The lessons for us Christians today are quite clear. We are prone to wander into sin, and we learn in Judges that our spiritual amnesia is the antecedent of such wandering. Unlike us, God is faithful to His covenant promises, and has sent us the greatest Deliverer - Jesus, who breaks our bondage to sin and delivers us into the Heavenly Promised land.
