The Mystery of Providence by John Flavel is the transcription of a series of sermons he preached in 1688, one hundred years after the beginning of the hard English Reformation. The Anglican church had grown primarily protestant in theology, and the Continent was enjoying a new protestant King and Queen.

This little Puritan Paperback is divided into three sections:

- Part I - The __Evidence__ for the Providence of God
- Part II - __Meditation__ on the Providence of God
- Part III - __Application__ of the Doctrine of Providence

I want to focus on Part II, the middle chapter of which is titled _How to Meditate on the Providence of God_. 

In this chapter Flavel gives explicit instruction on meditation, since his parishioners apparently needed help in that area. He reminds them to cultivate a deliberate slowness of mind when meditating on spiritual things: _"it is not every slight and transient glance, nor every cold, historical, unaffecting rehearsal or recognition of His providences towards you that will pass with God for a discharge of this great duty (p 117)"_; _"God does not judge as we do; we are all in haste and will have it now (p 139)._" If Flavel's congregation living in the late seventeenth century needed to slow down in their meditation, surely in our day need the same exhortation.

Here are the main points he stresses when practicing Christian meditation, inlined with my own thoughts and reflections.

### _Labor to get as full an thorough a recognition as you are able of the providences of God concerning you from the first to last_

_"Let your meditation be as intensively full as may be. Do not let your thoughts swim like feathers upon the surface of the waters, but sink like lead to the bottom. 'The works of the Lord are great, sought out of them that have pleasure therein' (Psalm 111:2). Not that I think it feasible to sound the depth of Providence by our short line: 'Thy way is in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps are not known' (Psalm 77:19), but __it is our duty to dive__ as far as we can; and to admire the depth, when we cannot touch the bottom_ (p 118, emphasis mine)."

Flavel's comparison of meditation to diving in the sea is the necessary corrective to our often task-oriented manner of living. Diving is an exploratory activity, not something to be done simply to get it done. And not only are we to dive deep, it is our _duty_ to. It's as if someone gave you the ocean as a gift; would it not be the least you could do to explore it in honor of your benefactor, let alone the sheer delight of doing so? This command to find enjoyment in God and His works is reminiscent of Westminster Catechism Question and Answer 1: 

> _"What is the chief end of man?"_
>
> _The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever."_

Meditation is both a duty and delight. If it is not a delight, we must work through the duty to the delight.

Tozer uses the same image in The Pursuit of God: _"What a broad world to roam in, what a sea to swim in is this God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ God is an ocean, and His providences are an ocean too.

But what is the 'content' of this sea? What is the ocean water of God's Providence to us?

In Part I of the book, Flavel trots out a long list of evidences that prove God's providential care of you: the circumstances of Your birth, the peaceful relationships you enjoy, your harmonious life in God, the prevention of your soul from sin, the blessing of gainful employment, His work in bringing you to the new birth. Consider also what he calls "leading providences", that though small and seemingly insignificant in themselves, "user in a multitude of other mercies" (p 119). Perhaps the first conversation with the person who became your spouse, or the unintended name drop that led to a new job. 

You can use these evidences of providence in your lift to begin meditation. I sometimes take Alistair Begg's advice to "read yourself full" of God's promises [(step 2 in his sermon-writing process)](https://blog.truthforlife.org/how-alistair-begg-prepares-a-sermon) when fostering meditation: I make a long list of these providences as I write out my prayers, expanding this or that one as my mind wanders over each, until both my page and my heart are full of thankfulness for God's mercies toward me.

### In all your observations of Providence have special respect to that Word of God which is fulfilled and made good to you by them

Joshua at the end of his life acknowledged that "not one good thing had failed of all the good things of which the Lord had spoken" (Joshua 22:14, p 121).

Has the Lord healed you from an illness? Consider Psalm 103 and bless the Lord who "heals all your diseases".

Perhaps you are downcast over a chronic sin that continues to defeat you in temptation. Consider that God has providentially warned you of the fruit of this sin in Romans 6:21 - _"But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death."_ The Lord warns you of the danger of continuing on the path of sin.

Maybe you are rejoicing over a recent answer to prayer after a great harship. Daniel experienced deliverance in the midst of his prayer: "While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people... while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel [said] ...  At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved" (Daniel 9:23, p 121).

### In all your reviews and observations of Providence, be sure that you eye God as the Author of them

In both the happy and sad providences, consider that both come from God. Neither praise yourself for the happy ones, as if you earned them by your own efforts, nor despair over the sad ones, as if you felt yourself untouchable or sovereign over your own affairs.

In the happy providences:
- "Remember He is 'Father of mercies' that begets every mercy for you, 'The God of all comfort' (2 Corinthians 1:3) without whose order no mercy or comfort can come to your hands" (p 128, 129).
- "Eye them all as comforts appointed to refresh you in your way to far better and greater mercies than themselves. [The best mercies are still reserved till last](/blog/36/the-outlook-of-the-christian), and all these are introductive to better" (p 130).

In the sad providences: _"It is not many years ago since we were not, and when it pleased Him to bring us upon the stage of action, we had no liberty of contracting with Him on what terms we would come into the world, or refuse to be ... He might have made you the most despicable creatures, worms or toads; or, if men, the most vile, abject and miserable among men; and when you had run through all the miseries of this life, have damned you to eternity, made you miserable forever, and all this without any wrong to you. And shall this not quieten us under the common afflictions of this life? ... O consider what temporal mercies are yet spared, and what spiritual mercies are bestowed and still continued to us, we shall find cause to admire mercy rather than complain of severity"_ (p 131).

When a sad providence blindsides you, consider that it comes from the God who does not change. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, Hebrews 13:8. He is ever in a caring posture towards His people in affliction, from the time of the Old Testament to the new - _"In all their affliction He was afflicted"_, Isaiah 63:9; "[cast] your cares on Him, for He cares for you", 1 Peter 5:7. He is not shaken or put into panic at any providence, since He is above them all - _"The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever"_, Psalm 29:10.

### Lastly, work up your hearts to those frames, and exercise those affections which the particular providences of God that concern you call for (Ecclesiastes 7:14)

There is a time to be happy, and there is a time to be sad. Flavel is simply asking us to tune our minds and hearts to God's providence towards us. This is beneficial because God grows different graces based on the differing providences He sends: "As there are various affections planted in your souls, so there are various graces planted in those affections, and various providences appointed to draw forth and exercise these graces" (p 132).

This tuning is necessary because we are too easily and primarily tuned to earthly material providences. This is to the neglect of the spiritual providences. "There are two sorts of comforts: natural and sensual [on one hand]; divine and spiritual [on the other]. There is a time when it becomes Christians to exercise both (Esther 9:22). And there is a time when the former is to be suspended and laid by (Psalm 137:2), but there is no season wherein spiritual joy and comfort in God is unseasonable (Philippians 4:4). This spiritual joy or comfort is nothing else but the cheerfulness of our heart in God, and the sense of our interest in Him and His promises" (p 133).

An aside: I would be careful to drive too sharp a gnostic-shaped wedge between natural and spiritual providences, as if the former is all bad. A material blessing comes from the hand of God just as much as an immaterial one, and a blessing we'd categorize as spiritual often has natural blessings that follow it. This can be a helpful paradigm as long as we don't categorize too sharply, or deprecate the material. Neither should the spiritual should not be set at odds with the material. I think Flavel is teaching us that we should be more receptive to those providences that we'd think of as more spiritual than natural.

_"Exercise heavenly-mindedness, and keep your hearts upon things eternal under all the providences with which the Lord exercises you in this world ... If we are under comfortable providences, how sensual, wanton and worldly do our hearts grow! And if sad providences befall us, how cast down or disturbed we are!"_ (p 134).

May the Lord help us to meditate on His works toward us, in tandem with His Word to us, to the delight of our souls and a growing steadiness of spirit!
